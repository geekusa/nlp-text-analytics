shortdesc = A wrapper for BeautifulSoup4 to extract html/xml tags and text from to use in Splunk.
description =  A wrapper script to bring some functionality from BeautifulSoup to Splunk. \
    Default is to get the text and send it to a new field 'get_text', otherwise the selection \
    is returned in a field named 'soup'. Default is to use the 'lxml' parser, though you can \
    specify others, 'html5lib' is not currently included. The find methods can be used in \
    conjuction, their order of operation is find > find_all > find_child > find children. \
    Each option has a similar named option appended '_attrs' that will accept inner and outer \
    quoted key:value pairs for more precise selections.

description = Tokenize and normalize text (remove punctuation, digits, change to base_word) \
    Different options result in better and slower cleaning. base_type="lemma_pos" being the \
    slowest option, base_type="lemma" assumes every word is a noun, which is faster but still \
    results in decent lemmatization. Many fields have a default already set, textfield is only \
    required field. By default results in a multi-valued field which is ready for used with \
    stats count by. Optionally return special fields for analysis--pos_tags and ngrams.

syntax = similarity textfield=<field> comparefield=<field> (algo=<similarity_algo-options>)? (limit=<int>)? (mvzip=<bool>)?
shortdesc = Returns distance and similarity scores between 0 and 1. Some algorithms also return number of steps to make text the same.
description = Returns distance and similarity scores between 0 and 1. \
    Some algorithms also return number of steps to make text the same. \
    Similarity (and distance) metrics can be used to tell how far apart to pieces of text \
    are and in some algorithms return also the number of steps to make the text the same. \
    These do not extract meaning, but are often used in text analytics to discover \
    plagurism, conduct fuzzy searching, spell checking, and more. Defaults to using the \
    Levenshtein distance algorithm but includes several other algorithms, include some set \
    based algorithms. Can handle multi-valued comparisons with an option to limit to a \
    given number of top matches. Multi-valued output can be zipped together or returned \
    seperately.

description = Sentiment analysis using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner \
    Using option full_output will return scores for neutral, positive, and negative which \
    are the scores that make up the compound score (that is just returned as the field \
    "sentiment". Best to feed in uncleaned data as it takes into account capitalization \
    and punctuation.
