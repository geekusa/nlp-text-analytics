Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,“What’s the matter?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?” “A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune, for me especially!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.” “And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"But poor Captain Leclere——” “What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“What happened to the worthy captain?” “He died.” “Fell into the sea?” “No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!” All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"0023m “Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.” “Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted at every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the young.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo——” “Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.” Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: “Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!” The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man- of-war.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.” The owner did not wait for a second invitation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?” “Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"He was a brave and an honest man.” “And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.” “Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.” 0025m “As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.” “The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.” “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!” “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said, “Let go!” The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!” “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.” “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.” “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.” A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"You hailed me, I think?” Danglars retreated a step or two.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?” “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.” “Then did you see him, Edmond?” “Who?” “The marshal.” “Yes.” Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly— “And how is the emperor?” “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.” “You saw the emperor, then?” “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.” “And you spoke to him?” “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“And what did he say to you?” “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’” “Pardieu!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.” 0027m “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"As he departed, Danglars approached, and said,— “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo?” “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.” “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.” “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.” “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?” “To me?—no—was there one?” “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.” “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?” “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.” “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?” Danglars turned very red.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.” “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.” Danglars reflected for a moment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,I may have been mistaken.” At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Yes, sir.” “You have not been long detained.” “No.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.” “Then you have nothing more to do here?” “No—everything is all right now.” “Then you can come and dine with me?” “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"My first visit is due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me.” 0029m “Right, Dantès, quite right.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"I always knew you were a good son.” “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?” “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.” “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.” “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.” Dantès smiled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.” “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.” “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.” “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.” Dantès blushed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,Peste!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!” “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.” “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"“Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Do you want any money?” “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.” “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.” “Say I have a poor father, sir.” “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.” “Then I have your leave, sir?” “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.” “Nothing.” “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?” “He was unable to write, sir.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.” “To get married?” “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.” “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the Pharaon,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.” “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon?” “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—Chi ha compagno ha padrone—‘He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.” “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.” “Shall I row you ashore?” “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?” “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,Do you mean is he a good comrade?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.” “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the Pharaon should you be glad to see Danglars remain?” “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.” “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"I see you are a thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Go, for I see how impatient you are.” “Then I have leave?” “Go, I tell you.” “May I have the use of your skiff?” “Certainly.” “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!” “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"Good luck to you.” The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"The two oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai d’Orléans.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival,"The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who, after having traversed La Canebière, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small house, on the left of the Allées de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,This room was occupied by Dantès’ father.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!” The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell into his arms, pale and trembling.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"“What ails you, my dearest father?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Are you ill?” inquired the young man, much alarmed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"“No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you; and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were going to die.” “Come, come, cheer up, my dear father!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,’Tis I—really I!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 2. Father and Son,Shall you never leave me again?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.” “God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?” “Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.” “Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and honeysuckle.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"But what ails you, father?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Are you not well?” “’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the old man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Have you wanted money, father?” “I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"“Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his brow,—“yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.” “Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor, Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,"He reminded me of it, telling me if I did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see, lest he might do you an injury——” “Well?” “Why, I paid him.” “But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Caderousse.” “Yes,” stammered the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 2. Father and Son,“And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?” The old man nodded.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 2. Father and Son,"Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and tomorrow we shall have more.” “Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return, in order to be able to purchase them.” “Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 2. Father and Son,"“But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time, so he’s welcome.” As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 3. The Catalans,"See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is well- behaved!” 0051m Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 3. The Catalans,"do you not see your friends, or are you too proud to speak to them?” “No, my dear fellow!” replied Dantès, “I am not proud, but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.” “Ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 4. Conspiracy,"Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the letter will be found upon him, or at his father’s, or in his cabin on board the Pharaon.” “Very good,” resumed Danglars; “now your revenge looks like common sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing, and write upon it, ‘To the king’s attorney,’ and that’s all settled.” And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 4. Conspiracy,"“Yes, and that’s all settled!” exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 4. Conspiracy,"“Yes, and that’s all settled; only it will be an infamous shame;” and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 4. Conspiracy,"“Yes,” said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; “and as what I say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost, should be sorry if anything happened to Dantès—the worthy Dantès—look here!” And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5.

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès.” “Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that honor yet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,Mercédès is not yet your wife.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Just assume the tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come!” The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"’Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour and a half she will be.” A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Now, as a quarter-past one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantès.” 0069m Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!” “But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you manage about the other formalities—the contract—the settlement?” “The contract,” answered Dantès, laughingly, “it didn’t take long to fix that.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.” This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Dantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the salon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“Upon my word,” said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès’ good fortune,—“upon my word, Dantès is a downright good fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday.” “Oh, there was no harm meant,” answered Danglars; “at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as to become one of his rival’s attendants, I knew there was no further cause for apprehension.” Caderousse looked full at Fernand—he was ghastly pale.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5.

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?” said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there is doubtless some mistake easily explained.” “If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?” Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice: “I am he; what is your pleasure with me?” “Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!” “Me!” repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, I pray?” “I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.” M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.” “What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"0073m “How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had disappeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"All I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.” “Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces.” “No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner.” “Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why, you were drunk!” “Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Never mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.” During this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that.” 0075m “Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group, “nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.” Dantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed by the soldiers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards Marseilles.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, “Good-bye, Mercédès—we shall soon meet again!” Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“Wait for me here, all of you!” cried M. Morrel; “I will take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word how all is going on.” “That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as quickly as you can!” This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s arms.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5.

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him, “of this event?” “Why,” replied he, “I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband.” “But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship’s supercargo?” “Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.” “Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!” “There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“Now the mischief is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.” Mercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s arrest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——” “With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 5.

Chapter 5.

Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon.” “Is it possible you were so kind?” “Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.” “And what was his reply?” “That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners would have his preference also.” “The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“No one can deny his being a noble- hearted young fellow.” “But meanwhile,” continued M.

Morrel,” answered Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast,"“You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.” “Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi,"This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air à l’Anglaise, and the ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral treasures.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 6.

Chapter 6.

Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi,“I forgive you.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi,"The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi,"Observe,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 6.

The Deputy Procureur du Roi,"“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.” “True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier became a senator.” “Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.” “Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 7. The Examination,"“Ah, ah,” murmured he, “is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"He was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty.” 0097m As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had left him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in the midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the prisoner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at Dantès, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, “Bring in the prisoner.” Rapid as had been Villefort’s glance, it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 7. The Examination,"“Who and what are you?” demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour’s time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt espionage of which “the accused” is always made the victim.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 7. The Examination,"“What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?” “I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"“You were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"“Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 7. The Examination,"“This philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M. de Saint- Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 7. The Examination,"“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?” And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.” Dantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would crush it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"“You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken to the Château d’If to be imprisoned there?” “It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.” “Without any inquiry, without any formality?” “All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already made.” “And so, in spite of M. de Villefort’s promises?” “I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,” said the gendarme, “but I know we are taking you to the Château d’If.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,But what are you doing?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 8.

Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and showed Dantès the features of his conductor, an under-jailer, ill- clothed, and of sullen appearance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"Goodnight.” And before Dantès could open his mouth—before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water—before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was, the jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door, leaving stamped upon the prisoner’s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"All his emotion then burst forth; he cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"The day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"One thought in particular tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and, thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercédès and his father could have joined him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,He had no fears as to how he should live—good seamen are welcome everywhere.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercédès and his father, whereas he was now confined in the Château d’If, that impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and Mercédès; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort’s promise.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"“Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?” “I wish to see the governor.” “I have already told you it was impossible.” “Why so?” “Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask for it.” “What is allowed, then?” “Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.” “I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to walk about; but I wish to see the governor.” “If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any more to eat.” “Well, then,” said Edmond, “if you do not, I shall die of hunger—that is all.” The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more subdued tone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"“What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and if he chooses to reply, that is his affair.” “But,” asked Dantès, “how long shall I have to wait?” “Ah, a month—six months—a year.” “It is too long a time.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"I wish to see him at once.” “Ah,” said the jailer, “do not always brood over what is impossible, or you will be mad in a fortnight.” “You think so?” “Yes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad, who was in this chamber before you.” 0119m “How long has he left it?” “Two years.” “Was he liberated, then?” “No; he was put in a dungeon.” “Listen!” said Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 8.

Chapter 8. The Château d’If,"The abbé began like you, and in three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but, fortunately, there are dungeons here.” Dantès whirled the stool round his head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 11. The Corsican Ogre,"“How strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ‘A murder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can add, ‘And we are on the track of the guilty persons.’” “Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at least.” “We shall see.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be recompensed.” “Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for.” “Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,What say you?” “I cannot believe such was the case.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"I was generally liked on board, and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"I had quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.” “Now we are getting on.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"And what was this man’s name?” “Danglars.” “What rank did he hold on board?” “He was supercargo.” “And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?” “Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts.” “Good again!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere?” “No; we were quite alone.” “Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?” “It might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now I recollect,—Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal.” “That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?” “Nobody.” “Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of it, I think?” “Yes; the grand marshal did.” “And what did you do with that letter?” “Put it into my portfolio.” “You had your portfolio with you, then?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Now, how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter?” “You are right; it was left on board.” “Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?” “No.” “And what did you do with this same letter while returning from Porto- Ferrajo to the vessel?” “I carried it in my hand.” “So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand?” “Yes.” “Danglars, as well as the rest?” “Danglars, as well as others.” “Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?” “Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.” “Repeat it to me.” Dantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"“The thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.” “Do you really think so?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Ah, that would indeed be infamous.” “How did Danglars usually write?” “In a handsome, running hand.” “And how was the anonymous letter written?” “Backhanded.” Again the abbé smiled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"“Disguised.” “It was very boldly written, if disguised.” “Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,“How very astonishing!” cried he at length.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"“Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.” “Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and I have noticed that——” “What?” “That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.” “You have evidently seen and observed everything.” “Let us proceed.” “Oh, yes, yes!” “Now as regards the second question.” “I am listening.” “Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès?” “Yes; a young man who loved her.” “And his name was——” “Fernand.” “That is a Spanish name, I think?” “He was a Catalan.” “You imagine him capable of writing the letter?” “Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me.” “That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.” “Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.” “You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?” “To no one.” “Not even to your mistress?” “No, not even to my betrothed.” “Then it is Danglars.” “I feel quite sure of it now.” “Wait a little.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?” “No—yes, he was.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand looked pale and agitated.” “Were they alone?” “There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named Caderousse, but he was very drunk.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 17.

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"“Old enough to be ambitious, but too young to be corrupt.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17.

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.” “By your misfortune?” “Yes.” “Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?” “He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.” “And that?” “He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.” “What?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"You tell me he burned the letter?” “He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you.’” “This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.” “You think so?” “I am sure of it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"To whom was this letter addressed?” “To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"13, Paris.” “Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?” “Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.” “Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 17.

Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber,"He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I must be alone, to think over all this.” When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 18. The Treasure,All this I did scrupulously.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o’clock in the afternoon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,0243m “I awoke as the clock was striking six.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,I raised my head; I was in utter darkness.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.” Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantès, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust: “This 25th day of April, 1498, be...

Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“And now,” he said, when he saw that Dantès had read the last line, “put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.” Dantès obeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following: 0245m “This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness Alexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my hat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place he knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss...essed of ingots, gold, money, jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this treasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns, and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small creek to the east in a right line.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought for,” replied Edmond, still incredulous.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“Yes; a thousand times, yes!” “And who completed it as it now is?” “I did.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.” “And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?” “I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.” “But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?” “No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.” “And you say this treasure amounts to——” “Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”2 “Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,“Impossible?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,and why?” asked the old man.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.” Edmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that I might test your character, and then surprise you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me thither.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?” “This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to you only.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,I have no right to it.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"I am no relation of yours.” “You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,“You are the child of my captivity.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,My profession condemns me to celibacy.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 18. The Treasure,"God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.” And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Now that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he expatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected how much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"They had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled in.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Thus a new, a stronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to Faria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"I have promised to remain forever with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"The treasure will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and happy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for terra firma, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.” Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns to make something from nothing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"They were thus perpetually employed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond returned to his cell.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,He opened his eyes upon utter darkness.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?” He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand, do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?” Edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!” Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"We must now only think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"It would require years to do again what I have done here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Besides, be assured, my dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Perhaps he will be young, strong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have been but a hindrance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"At length Providence has done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time I should die.” Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Quick, quick!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh instructions?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Speak, my friend; I listen.” “There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always so dear.” “Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you yet.” “Well, then, try.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 19. The Third Attack,I feel the blood flowing towards my brain.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.” “Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of life are now exhausted in me, and death,” he continued, looking at his paralyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"If, after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not recover, then pour the rest down my throat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Now lift me on my bed, for I can no longer support myself.” Edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched existence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 19. The Third Attack,It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"0255m The draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the old man’s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this period of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart’s pulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 19. The Third Attack,The inquiries soon commenced.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed, and declared that he was dead.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant, for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“I am very sorry for what you tell me,” said the governor, replying to the assurance of the doctor, “that the old man is really dead; for he was a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and required no watching.” “Ah,” added the turnkey, “there was no occasion for watching him; he would have stayed here fifty years, I’ll answer for it, without any attempt to escape.” “Still,” said the governor, “I believe it will be requisite, notwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your science, but in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead.” There was a moment of complete silence, during which Dantès, still listening, knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“You may make your mind easy,” said the doctor; “he is dead.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"I will answer for that.” “You know, sir,” said the governor, persisting, “that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"In spite of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law.” “Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really it is a useless precaution.” This order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"He heard hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying: “Here is the brazier, lighted.” There was a moment’s silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in horror.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"The perspiration poured forth upon the young man’s brow, and he felt as if he should faint.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“You see, sir, he is really dead,” said the doctor; “this burn in the heel is decisive.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered from his captivity.” “Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"0259m “Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"He was, too, very learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.” “It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,” said the doctor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,“You had never anything to complain of?” said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“Never, sir,” replied the jailer, “never; on the contrary, he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"One day, too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.” “Ah, ah!” said the doctor, “I did not know that I had a rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in consequence.” “Yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Will that satisfy you?” “Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?” inquired a turnkey.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,“Certainly.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"But make haste—I cannot stay here all day.” Other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached Dantès’ ears, the bed creaked, and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“This evening,” said the governor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,“Will there be any mass?” asked one of the attendants.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry, he might have had his requiem.” “Pooh, pooh;” said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his profession; “he is a churchman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"God will respect his profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.” A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"“Why, about ten or eleven o’clock.” “Shall we watch by the corpse?” “Of what use would it be?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that is all.” Then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,—the silence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 19. The Third Attack,"Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked carefully around the chamber.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,"On the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Faria’s last winding-sheet,—a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so little.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,"It is very easy,” he went on with a smile; “I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.” But excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,"Suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,"“Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,Is it from thee?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,"Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the place of the dead!” Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed, that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with the knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom; entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung off his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 20.

Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If,"0263m If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would allow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the grave- diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 20.

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which seemed to him softer than down.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès had not been deceived—he had reached the first of the two islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He knew that it was barren and without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He was safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty hours.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantès saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful rapidity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger, but they saw it themselves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the broken rudder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"At the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,Then all was dark again.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces; he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing—the cries had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"By degrees the wind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their foaming crests with gold.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,It was day.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the Château d’If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,It was about five o’clock.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,The sea continued to get calmer.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“In two or three hours,” thought Dantès, “the turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable to do for myself.” As Dantès (his eyes turned in the direction of the Château d’If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor’s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“Oh,” cried Edmond, “to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"My story will be accepted, for there is no one left to contradict me.” As he spoke, Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been wrecked, and started.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel’s keel, floated at the foot of the crag.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,In an instant Dantès’ plan was formed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“I am saved!” murmured he.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,And this conviction restored his strength.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking between the Château d’If and the tower of Planier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"For an instant he feared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea; but he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy, between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"However, the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès would have shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the vessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Then he advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her course.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"This time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"At the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless, and swam vigorously to meet them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"But he had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was almost breathless.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,He shouted again.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried in Italian, “Courage!” The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He rose again to the surface, struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The water passed over his head, and the sky turned gray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He felt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,His first care was to see what course they were taking.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,They were rapidly leaving the Château d’If behind.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"As we have said, he was lying on the deck.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"A sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who had cried out “Courage!” held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“Who are you?” said the pilot in bad French.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“I am,” replied Dantès, in bad Italian, “a Maltese sailor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.” “Where do you come from?” “From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"I saw your vessel, and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair.” “It was I,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; “and it was time, for you were sinking.” “Yes,” returned Dantès, holding out his hand, “I thank you again.” “I almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long.” Dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Château d’If.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“Yes,” said he, “I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires.” “Now what are we to do with you?” said the captain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“Alas, anything you please.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,My captain is dead; I have barely escaped; but I am a good sailor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be sure to find employment.” “Do you know the Mediterranean?” “I have sailed over it since my childhood.” “You know the best harbors?” “There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes.” “I say, captain,” said the sailor who had cried “Courage!” to Dantès, “if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?” “If he says true,” said the captain doubtingly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“But in his present condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it afterwards.” “I will do more than I promise,” said Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“We shall see,” returned the other, smiling.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“Where are you going?” asked Dantès.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“To Leghorn.” “Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?” “Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.” “You shall pass it by twenty fathoms.” “Take the helm, and let us see what you know.” The young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she yet was tolerably obedient.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“To the sheets,” said he.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"The four seamen, who composed the crew, obeyed, while the pilot looked on.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“Haul taut.” They obeyed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“Belay.” This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dantès had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“Bravo!” said the captain.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“Bravo!” repeated the sailors.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“You see,” said Dantès, quitting the helm, “I shall be of some use to you, at least during the voyage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.” “Ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are reasonable.” “Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,” returned Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“That’s not fair,” said the seaman who had saved Dantès; “for you know more than we do.” “What is that to you, Jacopo?” returned the Captain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“Everyone is free to ask what he pleases.” “That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a remark.” “Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.” “No,” said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.” “That is all I want,” interrupted Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“Hollo!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,what’s the matter at the Château d’If?” said the captain.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"A small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,The sailors looked at one another.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,“What is this?” asked the captain.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“At any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the better, for I have made a rare acquisition.” 0279m Under pretence of being fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,Dantès could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"“The 28th of February.” “In what year?” “In what year—you ask me in what year?” “Yes,” replied the young man, “I ask you in what year!” “You have forgotten then?” “I got such a fright last night,” replied Dantès, smiling, “that I have almost lost my memory.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"I ask you what year is it?” “The year 1829,” returned Jacopo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"It was fourteen years, day for day, since Dantès’ arrest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,He was nineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès, who must believe him dead.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen,"This oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of La Jeune Amélie (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible means of support.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smuggler.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d’If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s portraits.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Dantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,This was now all changed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,0283m To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"The master of La Jeune Amélie, who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"His next care on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a cap.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"0285m Evening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own, for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"The next morn broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing, for a ship’s lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Dantès noticed that the captain of La Jeune Amélie had, as he neared the land, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise, can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o’clock in the morning all the cargo was out of La Jeune Amélie and on terra firma.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 22. The Smugglers,"He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.” He had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to try and rise.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"Edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning pale.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"We will try and carry him on board the tartan.” Dantès declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“Well,” said the patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"We will not go till evening.” This very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me.” “But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“I would rather do so,” was Edmond’s reply, “than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.” The patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“What are we to do, Maltese?” asked the captain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“We cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay.” “Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“We shall be absent at least a week,” said the patron, “and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again.” “Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,I will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to Leghorn.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"If you do not come across one, return for me.” The patron shook his head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“Listen, Captain Baldi; there’s one way of settling this,” said Jacopo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.” “And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to remain with me?” “Yes,” said Jacopo, “and without any hesitation.” “You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,” replied Edmond, “and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do not wish anyone to stay with me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"A day or two of rest will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises.” A peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain alone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of a cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if he could not move the rest of his body.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"Then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,—“’Tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion.” Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set sail.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand, his pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo,"“And now,” he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman, which Faria had related to him, “now, Open Sesame!”",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"In a word, the island was inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of God.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his gun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed round in every direction.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"But it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could distinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the proud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just set sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other, following an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of Corsica.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,This sight reassured him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He then looked at the objects near him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He saw that he was on the highest point of the island,—a statue on this vast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a fringe of foam.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from observation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Then following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been so skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed the line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had buried his treasure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the circular rock.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his theory.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been lifted to this spot, without the aid of many men?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Instead of raising it, thought he, they have lowered it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"A large stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"0301m Dantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he detected, the ingenious artifice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He attacked this wall, cemented by the hand of time, with his pickaxe.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"After ten minutes’ labor the wall gave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"But the rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone man, were he Hercules himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Dantès saw that he must attack the wedge.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,But how?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"With the aid of his pickaxe, Dantès, after the manner of a labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He lighted it and retired.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces; thousands of insects escaped from the aperture Dantès had previously formed, and a huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure, rolled himself along in darkening coils, and disappeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned towards the sea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it, and, selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack, placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every nerve to move the mass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans, who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The rock yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally disappeared in the ocean.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"On the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring let into a square flag-stone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He would fain have continued, but his knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight became so dim, that he was forced to pause.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,This feeling lasted but for a moment.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès turned pale, hesitated, and reflected.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“Come,” said he to himself, “be a man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,I am accustomed to adversity.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"What, then, would be the use of all I have suffered?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The heart breaks when, after having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions destroyed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.” He remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress.” 0303m “But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?” asked Dantès of himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“The fate,” replied he, smiling, “of those who buried Alaric, and were interred with the corpse.” “Yet, had he come,” thought Dantès, “he would have found the treasure, and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"I will go down.” Then he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of human philosophy, “Perhaps!” But instead of the darkness, and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find, Dantès saw a dim and bluish light, which, as well as the air, entered, not merely by the aperture he had just formed, but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without, and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks, and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"After having stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp, Dantès’ eye, habituated as it was to darkness, could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“Alas,” said Edmond, smiling, “these are the treasures the cardinal has left; and the good abbé, seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has indulged in fallacious hopes.” But he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“In the farthest angle of the second opening,” said the cardinal’s will.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Dantès continued his search.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for precaution’s sake.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès’ forehead large drops of perspiration.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must be.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"However, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He again struck it, and with greater force.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Then a singular thing occurred.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,It was there he must dig.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"But by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that Faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give way, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"This last proof, instead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The island was deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the cavern.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"At last, after renewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,But to Dantès’ eye there was no darkness.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be decided.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Never did funeral knell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"“It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dantès seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little distance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner; but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended with this torch.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He wished to see everything.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He approached the hole he had dug, and now, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared, and Dantès could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut steel; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which was still untarnished, the arms of the Spada family—viz., a sword, en pale, on an oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings, and surmounted by a cardinal’s hat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès easily recognized them, Faria had so often drawn them for him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,There was no longer any doubt: the treasure was there—no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away, and he saw successively the lock, placed between two padlocks, and the two handles at each end, all carved as things were carved at that epoch, when art rendered the commonest metals precious.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès seized the handles, and strove to lift the coffer; it was impossible.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid, and pressing with all his force on the handle, burst open the fastenings.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"The hinges yielded in their turn and fell, still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest was open.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,0307m Edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless with amazement.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,Three compartments divided the coffer.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"In the first, blazed piles of golden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of unpolished gold, which possessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third, Edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, as they fell on one another, sounded like hail against glass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"After having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock, from whence he could behold the sea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He was alone—alone with these countless, these unheard-of treasures!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Was it a transient vision, or was he face to face with reality?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He would fain have gazed upon his gold, and yet he had not strength enough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of Monte Cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with his wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to believe the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"This time he fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively, uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"He soon became calmer and more happy, for only now did he begin to realize his felicity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,He then set himself to work to count his fortune.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"There were a thousand ingots of gold, each weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled up twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about eighty francs of our money, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,and his predecessors; and he saw that the complement was not half empty.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"And he measured ten double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which, mounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"Dantès saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised in the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours’ sleep, lying over the mouth of the cave.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 24. The Secret Cave,"It was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Day, for which Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes, again dawned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,With the first light Dantès resumed his search.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening, and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage- looking and untrodden as he had found it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"This done, he impatiently awaited the return of his companions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"To wait at Monte Cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among mankind, and to assume the rank, power, and influence which are always accorded to wealth—that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"On the sixth day, the smugglers returned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"From a distance Dantès recognized the rig and handling of La Jeune Amélie, and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his companions with an assurance that, although considerably better than when they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late accident.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,He then inquired how they had fared in their trip.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"To this question the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantès, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when, fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Upon the whole, however, the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while the crew, and particularly Jacopo, expressed great regrets that Dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"0311m Edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island; but as La Jeune Amélie had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to Leghorn.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The following day Dantès presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel, accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dantès, residing in the Allées de Meilhan, and also a young woman called Mercédès, an inhabitant of the Catalan village.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,The superior education of Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board La Jeune Amélie having expired, Dantès took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25.

Chapter 25. The Unknown,To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,Then Dantès departed for Genoa.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Dantès, struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel, applied to its owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand francs, upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,A bargain was therefore struck.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks, saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The builder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day, Dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"0313m Two hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa, under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the helm.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest touch; and Dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Some insisted she was making for Corsica, others the Island of Elba; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain; while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course; but no one thought of Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel, and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved herself a first-class sailor, and had come the distance from Genoa in thirty-five hours.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The island was utterly deserted, and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure was just as he had left it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches, and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,A week passed by.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service, till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The former Dantès proposed to augment, the latter to remedy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Cristo.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacopo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,He immediately signalled it.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"His signal was returned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside the yacht.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Old Dantès was dead, and Mercédès had disappeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,In a couple of hours he returned.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,"One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Château d’If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"0315m Still Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on the Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own sailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Going straight towards him, he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully watching the man’s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,Dantès instantly turned to meet him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the honest fellow, in almost breathless haste, “but I believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a two- franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon.” “Thank you, my good friend.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"I see that I have made a trifling mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask your messmates to join you.” So extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,"And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was obtained.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Though answered in the negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor’s emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"0317m When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25.

Chapter 25. The Unknown,"Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the Allées de Meilhan belonged, Dantès next proceeded thither, and, under the name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his passport), purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs, at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked half a million, it would unhesitatingly have been given.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house, now become the property of Dantès, were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds, etc., that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house, without the least augmentation of rent, upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the Allées de Meilhan, and a multitude of theories were afloat, none of which was anywhere near the truth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"But what raised public astonishment to a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance, was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the Allées de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the Catalans, and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman’s hut, and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25. The Unknown,"But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present, consisting of an entirely new fishing-boat, with two seines and a tender.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 25.

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,—a little nearer to the former than to the latter,—a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"All these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others being the Durance and the Parliament.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"In the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"And, as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the Spanish muleteers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Born in the neighborhood of Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"She remained nearly always in her second- floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door—a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words: “Hush, La Carconte.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"It is God’s pleasure that things should be so.” The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Still, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"0323m Like other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to display.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass—on which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly, endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate—to the deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he went, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the entrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Nevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"All I have is at his service.” The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking with a strong Italian accent, “You are, I presume, M.

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller’s face.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“Ah, sir,” said Caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest.” The abbé fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“Yes, honest—I can certainly say that much for myself,” continued the innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé’s gaze; “I can boast with truth of being an honest man; and,” continued he significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, “that is more than everyone can say nowadays.” 0327m “So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said the abbé; “for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be rewarded, and the wicked punished.” “Such words as those belong to your profession,” answered Caderousse, “and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he, with a bitter expression of countenance, “one is free to believe them or not, as one pleases.” “You are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and perhaps I may, in my own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.” “What mean you?” inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“In the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search of.” “What proofs do you require?” “Did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor named Dantès?” “Dantès?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,Did I know poor dear Edmond?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Why, Edmond Dantès and myself were intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.” “Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and eager.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Is he prosperous and happy?” “He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.” A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?” “You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,” observed the abbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied him his good fortune.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.” There was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"0329m “But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that Dantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer, that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.” “And so he was,” murmured Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,“How should he have been otherwise?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.” “And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.” And here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.” “Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?” “Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,“To one in Edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?” “It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn,"“But how comes the diamond in your possession, sir?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"M. de Boville was in his private room, and the Englishman, on perceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"As to M. de Boville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was evident all the faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment, did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"The Englishman, with the coolness of his nation, addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marseilles.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“Oh, sir,” exclaimed M. de Boville, “your fears are unfortunately but too well founded, and you see before you a man in despair.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son; these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter, who was to be married in a fortnight, and these two hundred thousand francs were payable, half on the 15th of this month, and the other half on the 15th of next month.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"I had informed M.

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, “From which it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension?” “To tell you the truth, I consider it lost.” “Well, then, I will buy it of you!” “You?” “Yes, I!” “But at a tremendous discount, of course?” “No, for two hundred thousand francs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28.

Chapter 28.

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“The commission is usually one and a half; will you have two—three—five per cent, or even more?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28.

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"I have since learned that he was confined in the Château d’If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his death.” “What was his name?” “The Abbé Faria.” “Oh, I recollect him perfectly,” cried M. de Boville; “he was crazy.” “So they said.” “Oh, he was, decidedly.” “Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?” “He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him.” “Poor devil!—and he is dead?” “Yes, sir, five or six months ago, last February.” “You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.” “I recollect this, because the poor devil’s death was accompanied by a singular incident.” “May I ask what that was?” said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbé’s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonaparte’s emissaries,—one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very resolute and very dangerous man.” “Indeed!” said the Englishman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“Yes,” replied M. de Boville; “I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two dungeons——” “Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this Edmond Dantès——” “This dangerous man’s name was——” “Edmond Dantès.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had procured tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another.” “This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?” “No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had an attack of catalepsy, and died.” “That must have cut short the projects of escape.” “For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not for the survivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château d’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.” “It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the Englishman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and, fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account.” “How was that?” “How?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"Do you not comprehend?” “No.” “The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into the sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.” “Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him into the sea.” “Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"“So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as the English do, “at the end of his teeth.” “And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, “he was drowned?” “Unquestionably.” “So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time?” “Precisely.” 20027m “But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?” inquired the Englishman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé, who really was gentleness itself.” “Yes, you will much oblige me.” “Go into my study here, and I will show it to you.” And they both entered M. de Boville’s study.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 28.

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"He folded up the accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application dated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by the deputy procureur’s advice, exaggerated with the best intentions (for Napoleon was then on the throne) the services Dantès had rendered to the imperial cause—services which Villefort’s certificates rendered indisputable.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 28. The Prison Register,"20029m As to the note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in Dantès’ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have quoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 29.

Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile, threw them into an almost empty drawer, saying: “Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.” Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M.

The Fifth of September,"As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low tone: “Be happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds.” 20064m And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his hiding- place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted “Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!” Then a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping with joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 30. The Fifth of September,"I have been Heaven’s substitute to recompense the good—now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!” At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the first society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz d’Épinay, were at Florence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy, should act as cicerone to Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the proprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve comfortable apartments for them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"They accepted his offer; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and lay down, and said to the crew,—“To the Island of Elba!” The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He traversed the island, after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re- embarked for Marciana.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you might have capital sport.” “Where?” “Do you see that island?” continued the captain, pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Well, what is this island?” “The Island of Monte Cristo.” “But I have no permission to shoot over this island.” “Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is uninhabited.” “Ah, indeed!” said the young man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“A desert island in the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity.” “It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.” “To whom does this island belong?” “To Tuscany.” “What game shall I find there!” “Thousands of wild goats.” “Who live upon the stones, I suppose,” said Franz with an incredulous smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks.” “Where can I sleep?” “On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like—we can sail as well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.” As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet available, he accepted the proposition.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Upon his answer in the affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Well,” asked he, “what now?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Is there any difficulty in the way?” “No.” replied the captain, “but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port.” “What do you mean?” “Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.” “The deuce!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Nor I, nor I,” chorused the sailors.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Then steer for Monte Cristo.” The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Franz waited until all was in order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken their places—three forward, and one at the helm—he resumed the conversation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Gaetano,” said he to the captain, “you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very different kind of game from the goats.” “Yes, your excellency, and it is true.” “I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.” “Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet, every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Has not your excellency heard that the French chargé d’affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri?” “Oh, yes, I heard that.” “Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but, doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who have surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some desert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest.” “But,” asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat, “why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French, Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?” “Why?” said Gaetano with a smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Yes, why?” “Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand and foot, they attach to everyone’s neck a four-and-twenty-pound ball, a large hole is chopped in the vessel’s bottom, and then they leave her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"First one gun’l goes under, then the other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Then they lift and sink again, and both go under at once.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,All at once there’s a noise like a cannon—that’s the air blowing up the deck.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Soon the water rushes out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Do you understand now,” said the captain, “why no complaints are made to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?” It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had started, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He was one of those men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself, combat it with the most unalterable coolness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Calm and resolute, he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel,—calculated its probable method of approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack, and won victory at a single thrust.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Bah!” said he, “I have travelled through Sicily and Calabria—I have sailed two months in the Archipelago, and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate.” “I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,” replied Gaetano, “but you questioned me, and I have answered; that’s all.” “Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.” The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant Adamastor, rose dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain, where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker; half an hour after, the night was quite dark.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every rock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz was not without uneasiness—Corsica had long since disappeared, and Monte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the lynx, to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"An hour had passed since the sun had set, when Franz fancied he saw, at a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not precisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he remained silent; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a cloud, but the fire was not a meteor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,“What is this light?” asked he.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Hush!” said the captain; “it is a fire.” “But you told me the island was uninhabited?” “I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.” “And for pirates?” “And for pirates,” returned Gaetano, repeating Franz’s words.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island, for, as you see, the fire is behind us.” “But this fire?” continued Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire.” “Oh, that goes for nothing,” said Gaetano.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.” “You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors?” “That is what we must find out,” returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“How can you find out?” “You shall see.” Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutes’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes the fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The pilot again changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the island, and was soon within fifty paces of it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Gaetano lowered the sail, and the boat came to rest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"All this was done in silence, and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the responsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him, while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As for Franz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two double- barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the priming, and waited quietly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and secured his trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no shoes and stockings to take off; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips, and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,This track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,“Well?” exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“They are Spanish smugglers,” said he; “they have with them two Corsican bandits.” “And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers?” “Alas,” returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity, “we ought always to help one another.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good fellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you can’t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for greater security we stand out to sea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"This costs us nothing, and saves the life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption.” “Ah!” said Franz, “then you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?” “Your excellency, we must live somehow,” returned the other, smiling impenetrably.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?” “Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by signs.” “And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?” “Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.” “But these two Corsican bandits?” said Franz, calculating the chances of peril.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the authorities.” “How so?” “Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in a Corsican’s nature to revenge himself.” “What do you mean by having made a stiff?—having assassinated a man?” said Franz, continuing his investigation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different thing,” returned the captain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Well,” said the young man, “let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Do you think they will grant it?” “Without doubt.” “How many are they?” “Four, and the two bandits make six.” “Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able to hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.” “Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.” “By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do more than permit, I exhort you.” “Silence, then!” said Gaetano.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Everyone obeyed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its true light, it was a grave one.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who had often examined his weapons,—which were very beautiful,—if not with envy, at least with curiosity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"On the other hand, he was about to land, without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed, a very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The history of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day, seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31.

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Gaetano skirted the light, carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite the fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a fishing song, of which his companions sung the chorus.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31.

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Not a word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, Franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who, turning to the boat, said, “S’accommodi.” The Italian s’accommodi is untranslatable; it means at once, “Come, enter, you are welcome; make yourself at home; you are the master.” It is like that Turkish phrase of Molière’s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few words with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The boat was moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out: “Not that way, if you please.” Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"They advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike sentry- boxes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the wandering visitors of Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As for his suspicions, once on terra firma, once that he had seen the indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had quite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to appetite.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Besides,” added he, “if the smell of their roast meat tempts you, I will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.” “You are a born diplomat,” returned Franz; “go and try.” Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Well,” said Franz, “anything new?—do they refuse?” “On the contrary,” returned Gaetano, “the chief, who was told you were a young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.” “Well,” observed Franz, “this chief is very polite, and I see no objection—the more so as I bring my share of the supper.” “Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive you at his house.” “His house?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Has he built one here, then?” “No, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.” “You know this chief, then?” “I have heard talk of him.” “Favorably or otherwise?” “Both.” “The deuce!—and what is this condition?” “That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you.” Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he thought of this proposal.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Ah,” replied he, guessing Franz’s thought, “I know this is a serious matter.” “What should you do in my place?” “I, who have nothing to lose,—I should go.” 20075m “You would accept?” “Yes, were it only out of curiosity.” “There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?” “Listen,” said Gaetano, lowering his voice, “I do not know if what they say is true”—he stopped to see if anyone was near.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Gaetano departed with the reply.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He turned towards the sailor, who, during this dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office, and asked him how these men had landed, as no vessel of any kind was visible.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Never mind that,” returned the sailor, “I know their vessel.” “Is it a very beautiful vessel?” “I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.” “Of what burden is she?” “About a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"She is what the English call a yacht.” “Where was she built?” “I know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.” “And how did a leader of smugglers,” continued Franz, “venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?” “I did not say that the owner was a smuggler,” replied the sailor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“No; but Gaetano did, I thought.” “Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then spoken to anyone.” “And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?” “A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.” “Come,” thought Franz, “he is still more mysterious, since the two accounts do not agree.” “What is his name?” “If you ask him, he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his real name.” “Sinbad the Sailor?” “Yes.” “And where does he reside?” “On the sea.” “What country does he come from?” “I do not know.” “Have you ever seen him?” “Sometimes.” “What sort of a man is he?” “Your excellency will judge for yourself.” “Where will he receive me?” “No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.” “Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?” “Oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto all over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening; they say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.” “Decidedly,” muttered Franz, “this is an Arabian Nights’ adventure.” “His excellency waits for you,” said a voice, which he recognized as that of the sentinel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,He promised.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and preceded by the sentinel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"After going about thirty paces, he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther, evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow Gaetano to go—a refusal he could now comprehend.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Presently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were entering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling, and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed, and became balmy and perfumed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"At length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet, and his guides let go their hold of him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"There was a moment’s silence, and then a voice, in excellent French, although, with a foreign accent, said: “Welcome, sir.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I beg you will remove your bandage.” It may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a Tunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk tassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep red, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold like the vest, and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist, and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek type, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"His pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made, and, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"But what astonished Franz, who had treated Gaetano’s description as a fable, was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers of gold.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of Arabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with gems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful shape and color, while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which they sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered, and also in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover, returned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Sir,” he said, after a pause, “a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither; but as, during the greater portion of the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of this abode were discovered, I should doubtless, find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder, which would be exceedingly annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because I should not have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here—that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds.” “Ma foi, my dear sir,” replied Franz, “make no apologies.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I have always observed that they bandage people’s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the Huguenots, and really I have nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of the wonders of the Arabian Nights.” 20079m “Alas!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the honor of your visit, I would have prepared for it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"But such as is my hermitage, it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to share, if you will.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Ali, is the supper ready?” At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony, and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Now,” said the unknown to Franz, “I do not know if you are of my opinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,I only request you to give me one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As for myself, that I may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’” “And I,” replied Franz, “will tell you, as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good genius.” “Well, then, Signor Aladdin,” replied the singular Amphitryon, “you heard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to enter the dining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?” At these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas- reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment, which was oblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit; there were Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from the Balearic Isles, peaches from France, and dates from Tunis.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican blackbirds; a boar’s ham with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce, a glorious turbot, and a gigantic lobster.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The dishes were of silver, and the plates of Japanese china.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Yes,” replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace—“yes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does all he can to prove it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He remembers that I saved his life, and as he has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders.” Ali approached his master, took his hand, and kissed it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,” said Franz, “to ask you the particulars of this kindness?” 20081m “Oh, they are simple enough,” replied the host.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the Bey to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I always had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of having.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil’s punishment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I had shivered his highness’s yataghan to pieces, the Bey yielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"This was a useless clause in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe.” Franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the brief narrative.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,” he said, by way of changing the conversation, “you pass your life in travelling?” “Yes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be able to accomplish it,” said the unknown with a singular smile; “and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.” Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“You have suffered a great deal, sir?” said Franz inquiringly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, “What makes you suppose so?” “Everything,” answered Franz,—“your voice, your look, your pallid complexion, and even the life you lead.” “I?—I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,I am king of all creation.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I am pleased with one place, and stay there; I get tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings like one; my attendants obey my slightest wish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Sometimes I amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Then I have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Ah, if you had tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there.” “Revenge, for instance!” observed Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,“And why revenge?” he asked.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Because,” replied Franz, “you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by society, has a fearful account to settle with it.” “Ah!” responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which displayed his white and sharp teeth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,“You have not guessed rightly.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Such as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the little blue cloak.” “And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?” “Yes; it will.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so long—it will happen one day or the other.” 20083m “And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?” “I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements.” “I should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor to repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at Monte Cristo.” “I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,” replied the host, “but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all probability, incognito.” The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Then Ali brought on the dessert, or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franz’s curiosity.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly unknown to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“You cannot guess,” said he, “what there is in that small vase, can you?” “No, I really cannot.” “Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.” “But,” replied Franz, “this ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which, to tell the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?” “Ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,” cried Sinbad; “we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without regarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Are you a man for the substantials, and is gold your god?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"taste this, and the boundaries of possibility disappear; the fields of infinite space open to you, you advance free in heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"taste this, and in an hour you will be a king, not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France, Spain, or England, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of creation; without bowing at the feet of Satan, you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Is it not tempting what I offer you, and is it not an easy thing, since it is only to do thus?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"look!” At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his lips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired: “What, then, is this precious stuff?” “Did you ever hear,” he replied, “of the Old Man of the Mountain, who attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?” “Of course I have.” “Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"In this valley were magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens isolated pavilions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and there, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which transported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs, ever-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"What these happy persons took for reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous, so enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck down the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight foretaste.” “Then,” cried Franz, “it is hashish!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"I know that—by name at least.” “That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish—the purest and most unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,—the hashish of Abou-Gor, the celebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a palace, inscribed with these words, A grateful world to the dealer in happiness.” “Do you know,” said Franz, “I have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.” “Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin—judge, but do not confine yourself to one trial.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"There is a struggle in nature against this divine substance,—in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Nature subdued must yield in the combat, the dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme, then the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,But what changes occur!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer, but to dream thus forever.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"When you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a Lapland winter—to quit paradise for earth—heaven for hell!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Taste the hashish, guest of mine—taste the hashish.” Franz’s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift it to his mouth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“Diable!” he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.” “Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters, tea, porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did you like them?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida, and the Chinese eat swallows’ nests?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Eh?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,no!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Well, it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears to you flat and distasteful.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Let us now go into the adjoining chamber, which is your apartment, and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes.” They both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad—and whom we have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title by which to distinguish him—gave some orders to the servant, Franz entered still another apartment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,It was simply yet richly furnished.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"It was round, and a large divan completely encircled it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from Bengal; panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those that appeared to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway, and so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on the most luxurious bed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Each of them took one, which Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"There was a moment’s silence, during which Sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his conversation; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie, into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,Ali brought in the coffee.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“How do you take it?” inquired the unknown; “in the French or Turkish style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As you please; it is ready in all ways.” “I will take it in the Turkish style,” replied Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"“And you are right,” said his host; “it shows you have a tendency for an Oriental life.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men who know how to live.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"As for me,” he added, with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man, “when I have completed my affairs in Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should you wish to see me again, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.” 20087m “Ma foi,” said Franz, “it would be the easiest thing in the world; for I feel eagle’s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in four-and-twenty hours.” “Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Well, unfurl your wings, and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over you; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we are here to ease your fall.” He then said something in Arabic to Ali, who made a sign of obedience and withdrew, but not to any distance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"All the bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses seemed to redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer breeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his sailors,—songs so clear and sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down,—he saw the Island of Monte Cristo, no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the desert; then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some Loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build a city.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"At length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock, as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"He descended, or rather seemed to descend, several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from such perfumes as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from Sinbad, his singular host, to Ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of statues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"They were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"They were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Then among them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian angel in the midst of Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those soft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves, and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"Lips of stone turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor,"The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses, and the enchantment of his marvellous dream.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"When Franz returned to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He thought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he rose to his seat, and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather, very soft and odoriferous.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"The vision had fled; and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at his waking.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors were sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view of the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He recalled his arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief, a subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a spoonful of hashish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"It seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Otherwise, his head was perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from the slightest headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of lightness, a faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him; and the patron, accosting him, said: “The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important business calls him to Malaga.” “So, then, Gaetano,” said Franz, “this is, then, all reality; there exists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right royally, and has departed while I was asleep?” “He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.” So saying, Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of Corsica.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Franz adjusted his telescope, and directed it towards the yacht.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,Gaetano was not mistaken.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He was attired as he had been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"After a second, a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air, and then Franz heard a slight report.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“There, do you hear?” observed Gaetano; “he is bidding you adieu.” The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,“What are your excellency’s orders?” inquired Gaetano.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“In the first place, light me a torch.” “Ah, yes, I understand,” replied the patron, “to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"With much pleasure, your excellency, if it would amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"But I too have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has come over me; but I have always given it up.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Giovanni, light a torch,” he added, “and give it to his excellency.” Giovanni obeyed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean grotto, followed by Gaetano.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,He recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He saw nothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"All was vain; and he lost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"At the end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He looked again through his glass, but even then he could not distinguish anything.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats, which he had utterly forgotten.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He took his fowling-piece, and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"These animals, though wild and agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz could not consider them as game.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Moreover, other ideas, much more enthralling, occupied his mind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Since, the evening before, he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the Thousand and One Nights, and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second, after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"The second visit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and he saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave, continuing her flight towards Corsica.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Why,” he remarked to Gaetano, “you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of Porto-Vecchio.” “Don’t you remember,” said the patron, “I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands?” “True; and he is going to land them,” added Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Precisely so,” replied Gaetano.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Ah, he is one who fears neither God nor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service.” 20093m “But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,” said Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“And what cares he for that,” replied Gaetano with a laugh, “or any authorities?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,He smiles at them.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,Let them try to pursue him!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Why, in the first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?” It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz’s host, had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional privileges.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being ready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish, statues,—all became a dream for Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"The boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun rose, they had lost sight of Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment at least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mail-coach.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"An apartment, as we have said, had been retained beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini’s hotel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"But this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events in every year,—the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast of St. Peter.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy, between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next—a sublime spot, a resting-place full of poetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"At last he made his way through the mob, which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"On his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there was no room for him at the Hôtel de Londres.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"This plan succeeded; and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made his excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from the porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,The two rooms looked on to the street—a fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Very good, signor Pastrini,” said Franz; “but we must have some supper instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.” “As to supper,” replied the landlord, “you shall be served immediately; but as for the carriage——” “What as to the carriage?” exclaimed Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Come, come, Signor Pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.” “Sir,” replied the host, “we will do all in our power to procure you one—this is all I can say.” “And when shall we know?” inquired Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Oh, the deuce!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"then we shall pay the more, that’s all, I see plainly enough.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"At Drake’s or Aaron’s one pays twenty-five lire for common days, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for Sundays and feast days; add five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and there’s an end of it.” “I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage.” “Then they must put horses to mine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"It is a little worse for the journey, but that’s no matter.” “There are no horses.” Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Do you understand that, my dear Franz—no horses?” he said, “but can’t we have post-horses?” “They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting.” “What are we to say to this?” asked Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“I say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"Is supper ready, Signor Pastrini?” “Yes, your excellency.” “Well, then, let us sup.” “But the carriage and horses?” said Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 32. The Waking,"“Be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them.” Morcerf then, with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept soundly, and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six horses.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"The next morning Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Well, excellency,” said the landlord triumphantly, and without waiting for Franz to question him, “I feared yesterday, when I would not promise you anything, that you were too late—there is not a single carriage to be had—that is, for the three last days” “Yes,” returned Franz, “for the very three days it is most needed.” “What is the matter?” said Albert, entering; “no carriage to be had?” “Just so,” returned Franz, “you have guessed it.” “Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.” “That is to say, excellency,” replied Pastrini, who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the eyes of his guest, “that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday to Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you please.” “Ah, that is something,” said Albert; “today is Thursday, and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday?” “Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,” replied Franz, “which will make it still more difficult.” “My friend,” said Morcerf, “let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future.” “At least we can have a window?” “Where?” “In the Corso.” “Ah, a window!” exclaimed Signor Pastrini,—“utterly impossible; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace, and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day.” The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Well,” said Franz to Albert, “do you know what is the best thing we can do?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.” “Ah, the devil, no,” cried Albert; “I came to Rome to see the Carnival, and I will, though I see it on stilts.” “Bravo!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,an excellent idea.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete success.” “Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning?” “Parbleu!” said Albert, “do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers’ clerks?” “I hasten to comply with your excellencies’ wishes; only, I tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.” “And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next apartments,” said Franz, “I warn you, that as I have been four times before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you will make a good profit.” “But, excellency”—said Pastrini, still striving to gain his point.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Now go,” returned Franz, “or I shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out of me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will lose the preference, and that will be your fault.” “Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,” returned Signor Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat; “I will do all I can, and I hope you will be satisfied.” “And now we understand each other.” “When do you wish the carriage to be here?” “In an hour.” “In an hour it will be at the door.” An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Excellency,” cried the cicerone, seeing Franz approach the window, “shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?” Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse was to look round him, but these words were addressed to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"Franz was the “excellency,” the vehicle was the “carriage,” and the Hôtel de Londres was the “palace.” The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"Franz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the cicerone sprang into the seat behind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,“Where do your excellencies wish to go?” asked he.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“To Saint Peter’s first, and then to the Colosseum,” returned Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peter’s, and a month to study it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,The day was passed at Saint Peter’s alone.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,Suddenly the daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watch—it was half-past four.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 33.

Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,They sat down to dinner.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Excellency,” said Pastrini, “I am delighted to have your approbation, but it was not for that I came.” “Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?” asked Albert, lighting his cigar.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer; at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything cannot be done, there is an end of it.” “It is much more convenient at Paris,—when anything cannot be done, you pay double, and it is done directly.” “That is what all the French say,” returned Signor Pastrini, somewhat piqued; “for that reason, I do not understand why they travel.” “But,” said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs, “only madmen, or blockheads like us, ever do travel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder, their walk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Café de Paris.” It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street, appeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good terms with its waiters.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he was musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33.

Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"You have told your coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni?” “These are my words exactly.” “Well, this route is impossible.” “Impossible!” “Very dangerous, to say the least.” “Dangerous!—and why?” “On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.” “Pray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?” inquired Albert; “he may be very famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite unknown at Paris.” “What!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"do you not know him?” “I have not that honor.” “You have never heard his name?” “Never.” “Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere children.” “Now then, Albert,” cried Franz, “here is a bandit for you at last.” “I forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"‘Once upon a time——’ Well, go on.” Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two; we must do him justice,—he had had a great many Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Roman Bandits,"“Excellency,” said he gravely, addressing Franz, “if you look upon me as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your interest I——” “Albert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us,—but I will believe all you say; so proceed.” “But if your excellency doubt my veracity——” “Signor Pastrini,” returned Franz, “you are more susceptible than Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while you, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"Come, sit down, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.” “I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of Mastrilla.” “Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni?” 20101m “This,” replied Signor Pastrini, “that you will go out by one, but I very much doubt your returning by the other.” “Why?” asked Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the gates.” “On your honor, is that true?” cried Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Count,” returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert’s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions, “I do not say this to you, but to your companion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to be laughed at.” “My dear fellow,” said Albert, turning to Franz, “here is an admirable adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and double-barrelled guns.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him—we bring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage, and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their country.” Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini’s face assumed an expression impossible to describe.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“And pray,” asked Franz, “where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?” “Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my hunting-knife.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"And you?” “I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.” “Do you know, Signor Pastrini,” said Albert, lighting a second cigar at the first, “that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.” Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he only answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the only one likely to listen with attention.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.” “What!” cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely, “not make any resistance!” “No, for it would be useless.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Roman Bandits,"At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the money is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner’s brains with a pistol- shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the account.” “Well, Albert,” inquired Franz of his companion, “are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?” “Quite so,” said Albert, “if the way be picturesque.” The clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Excellencies,” said he, “the coach is ready.” “Well, then,” said Franz, “let us to the Colosseum.” “By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?” “By the streets, morbleu!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,by the streets!” cried Franz.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,"“Ah, my dear fellow,” said Albert, rising, and lighting his third cigar, “really, I thought you had more courage.” So saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the carriage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 33. Roman Bandits,20131m,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The road selected was a continuation of the Via Sistina; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli, the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the Colosseum.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"This itinerary possessed another great advantage,—that of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrini’s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed up.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage, he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"One fact more than the rest brought his friend “Sinbad the Sailor” back to his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastrini’s account of Vampa’s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which had even deviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The very name assumed by his host of Monte Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the Hôtel de Londres, abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of Piombino, Civita Vecchia, Ostia, and Gaëta, as on those of Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and further, Franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of Tunis and Palermo, proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting, found themselves opposite a cicerone, who appeared to have sprung up from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two conductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply of guides; besides the ordinary cicerone, who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the city, there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument—nay, almost to each part of a monument.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"It may, therefore, be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum, that wonder of all ages, which Martial thus eulogizes: “Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars, and the many voices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument.” As for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Thus, then, the young men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian; and, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity of the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and more especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to the guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as regularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal, beginning, as a matter of course, with the “Lions’ Den”, the “Hall of the Gladiators” and finishing with “Cæsar’s Podium”), to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded, Franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to follow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column, and immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting- place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"There was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that someone, who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard, was approaching the spot where he sat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase opposite, upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like Franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded, stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took, convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"By a sort of instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features, although his dress was easily made out.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"He wore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon, which, entering through the broken ceiling, shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather, over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"20135m From the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to one conclusion,—that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then, as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere costume.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“I beg your excellency’s pardon for keeping you waiting,” said the man, in the Roman dialect, “but I don’t think I’m many minutes after my time, ten o’clock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran.” “Say not a word about being late,” replied the stranger in purest Tuscan; “’tis I who am too soon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"But even if you had caused me to wait a little while, I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours.” “Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,” said the man; “I came here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.” “And who is Beppo?” “Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness’s castle.” “Indeed!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"You are a provident person, I see.” “Why, you see, no one knows what may happen.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out of prison.” “Briefly, what did you learn?” “That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o’clock, as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great festivals.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"One of the culprits will be mazzolato;3 he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who brought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato;4 and he, your excellency, is poor Peppino.” “The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical government, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.” “But Peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor shepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.” “Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"But mark the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every spectator.” “Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them with.” “My good friend,” said the man in the cloak, “excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act.” “Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this scrape solely from having served me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I should hate and despise myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.” “And what do you mean to do?” “To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal from me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution, and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and carry off the prisoner.” “That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours.” “And what is your excellency’s project?” “Just this.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino; and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison.” “And do you feel sure of succeeding?” “Pardieu!” exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly expressing himself in French.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,“What did your excellency say?” inquired the other.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“I said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos, pistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Leave me, then, to act, and have no fears for the result.” “At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness, in case your excellency should fail.” “None whatever.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Take what precautions you please, if it is any satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I seek.” “Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that you have but one day to work in.” “And what of that?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty seconds?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.” “And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.” “Oh, that is very easily arranged.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks, and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.” “And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution?” “Send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will give it to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer, who, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.” “Your excellency,” said the man, “you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you, are you not?” “Nay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,” replied the cavalier in the cloak.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another.” “Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period, when I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.” “Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what I have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of——” “Hush!” interrupted the stranger; “I hear a noise.” “’Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight.” “’Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I may be honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our intimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby.” “Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?” “The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white damask, bearing a red cross.” “And if you fail?” “Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.” “And then?” “And then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please, and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.” “We understand each other perfectly, then.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Adieu, your excellency; depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.” Saying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase, while his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the sound of his friend’s name.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz, however, did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"In ten minutes after the strangers had departed, Franz was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert, after the manner of Pliny and Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that had occurred.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to him, but not so the other; and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them, hear them when or where he might.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"It was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that Franz’s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"And the more he thought, the more entire was his conviction, that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer, “Sinbad the Sailor.” 20139m Under any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage, and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but in the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"As we have seen, therefore, he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition, but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the firmer grew his opinion on the subject.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Worn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till late.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write, relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"At five o’clock Albert returned, delighted with his day’s work; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the remarkable sights at Rome.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Yes, in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers appeared in it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The opera of Parisina was announced for representation, and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La Specchia.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of Lucia di Lammermoor, supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of Italy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the Opera.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have his labor for his pains.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"And the thing was so much the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love- affairs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Alas, poor Albert!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"None of those interesting adventures fell in his way; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are faithful even in their infidelity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there might be an exception to the general rule.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a viscount—a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf commanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,It was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling observation.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated, Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The Carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The box taken by Albert was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled the “nobility’s boxes,” and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons, it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Another motive had influenced Albert’s selection of his seat,—who knew but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Totally disregarding the business of the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the “Holy Week” that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings, to listen to some brilliant effort of Moriani’s, a well-executed recitative by Coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of La Specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily: “Do you know the woman who has just entered that box?” “Yes; what do you think of her?” “Oh, she is perfectly lovely—what a complexion!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,And such magnificent hair!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Is she French?” “No; a Venetian.” “And her name is——” “Countess G——.” “Ah, I know her by name!” exclaimed Albert; “she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villefort’s ball.” “Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?” asked Franz.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?” “Why, I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.” At that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Upon my word,” said Albert, “you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess.” “You are mistaken in thinking so,” returned Franz calmly; “but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders,—I mean that of judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions; believe me, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess—nothing more.” “Is there, indeed, my good fellow?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Pray tell me, is it sympathy of heart?” “No; of taste,” continued Franz gravely.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?” “By the countess’s visiting the Colosseum, as we did last night, by moonlight, and nearly alone.” “You were with her, then?” “I was.” “And what did you say to her?” “Oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument!” “Upon my word,” cried Albert, “you must have been a very entertaining companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"How exquisitely Coselli sings his part.” “But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.” “Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting?” “Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to Malibran and Sontag, such singers as these don’t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others.” “At least, you must admire Moriani’s style and execution.” “I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman’s.” “My good friend,” said Franz, turning to him, while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre, “you seem determined not to approve; you are really too difficult to please.” The curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and wristbands, and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to retard the gratification of Albert’s eager impatience, but began at once the tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his coat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34.

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents; nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the circle in which the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris, was most anxious to make up for it, and had requested him (Franz) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box, and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the vacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if he wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own chair.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and, unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up Albert’s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Sitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated on the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek costume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore it, was her national attire.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“All I can tell about her,” replied the countess, “is, that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season, and since then she has never missed a performance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black servant.” “And what do you think of her personal appearance?” “Oh, I consider her perfectly lovely—she is just my idea of what Medora must have been.” Franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The curtain rose on the ballet, which was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably arranged and put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art—one of those masterly productions of grace, method, and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet, from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of volition, influenced the moving mass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,The ballet was called Poliska.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"However much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never even moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the trumpets, cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Of this he took no heed, but was, as far as appearances might be trusted, enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the loud, unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the leader’s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she became as absorbed as before in what was going on.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34.

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience, and was about to join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the half-uttered “bravos” expired on his lips.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,All doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host evidently resided at Rome.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of Franz’s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features; for the countess, after gazing with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of laughter, and begged to know what had happened.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Countess,” returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery, “I asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the Albanian lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband?” “Nay,” answered the countess, “I know no more of him than yourself.” “Perhaps you never before noticed him?” “What a question—so truly French!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Do you not know that we Italians have eyes only for the man we love?” “True,” replied Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“All I can say is,” continued the countess, taking up the lorgnette, and directing it toward the box in question, “that the gentleman, whose history I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave- digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"How ghastly pale he is!” “Oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,” said Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,“Then you know him?” almost screamed the countess.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Oh, pray do, for heaven’s sake, tell us all about—is he a vampire, or a resuscitated corpse, or what?” “I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.” “And I can well understand,” said the countess, shrugging up her beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins, “that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him.” The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Well.” inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box, “what do you think of our opposite neighbor?” 20147m “Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form.” This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franz’s countenance; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“I must positively find out who and what he is,” said Franz, rising from his seat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"It was quite evident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread—so much the stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34.

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,” said Franz, “that the countess’s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,Did he speak in your hearing?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,and did you catch any of his words?” “I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,I knew that from the mixture of Greek words.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I don’t know whether I ever told you that when I was at college I was rather—rather strong in Greek.” “He spoke the Romaic language, did he?” “I think so.” “That settles it,” murmured Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"But tell me, what were you thinking about when I came in?” “Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.” “Indeed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Of what nature?” “Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.” “Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one.” “Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain.” Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“I tell you what, M.

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I dare say such a thing might be had.” “Very possibly.” “And a pair of oxen?” “As easily found as the cart.” “Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Our group would then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a Madonna.” “Well,” said Franz, “this time, M.

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“A very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot exactly say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold mine.” “It seems to me,” said Franz, speaking in an undertone to Albert, “that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"The Count of Monte Cristo,” continued the servant, “begs these gentlemen’s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him.” “Faith, Franz,” whispered Albert, “there is not much to find fault with here.” “Tell the count,” replied Franz, “that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him.” The servant bowed and retired.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"What say you, Franz?” “Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided me.” The truth was, that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli had recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the Transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this muffled-up individual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as the person he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina, then he should be able to establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

The Colosseum,"The reason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits, and, above all, beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere repentance.” “And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful, are they?” asked Franz somewhat incredulously.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Oh, dear, no, your excellency!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I have not time for anybody’s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me as he would the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc.” “Upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part, Signor Pastrini,” cried Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Why, your excellency,” returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency, “I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel.” “I see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I go.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas.” “Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency’s wish,” said the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; “I have caused one to be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.” Then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read as follows: “‘The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23rd, being the first day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the Piazza del Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons, named Andrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named Don César Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“‘The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men, that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt, and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes.’” This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosseum.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"No part of the programme differed,—the names of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed with his previous information.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"In all probability, therefore, the Transteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as “Sinbad the Sailor,” but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.” “Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly?” 20155m “Oh, I am quite sure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an error.” “Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?” “Perfectly.” “Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.” “Yes, let us do so.” The landlord preceded the friends across the landing, which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count, rang at the bell, and, upon the door being opened by a servant, said: “I signori Francesi.” The domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"“Well,” said Franz to his friend, “what think you of all this?” “Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling incog.” “Hush, hush!” replied Franz; “we shall ascertain who and what he is—he comes!” As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 34. The Colosseum,"Albert instantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his extraordinary host of Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Gentlemen,” said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, “I pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides, you sent me word that you would come to me, and I have held myself at your disposal.” “Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,” returned Albert; “you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us.” “Indeed,” returned the count, motioning the two young men to sit down.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services.” The two young men bowed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he had come to no determination, and as nothing in the count’s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him, he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past, or wait until he had more proof; besides, although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening, he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"He resolved, therefore, to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Moreover, he had this advantage, he was master of the count’s secret, while the count had no hold on Franz, who had nothing to conceal.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Count,” said he, “you have offered us places in your carriage, and at your windows in the Rospoli Palace.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo?” “Ah,” said the count negligently, looking attentively at Morcerf, “is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo?” “Yes,” returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to the point he wished.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count, “you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.” “Yes, excellency,” returned the steward; “but it was very late.” “Did I not tell you I wished for one?” replied the count, frowning.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but I was obliged to pay a hundred——” “That will do—that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Ah!” continued the count, “be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the tavoletta, and if he can send us an account of the execution.” “There is no need to do that,” said Franz, taking out his tablets; “for I saw the account, and copied it down.” “Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; I need you no longer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,Let us know when breakfast is ready.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"These gentlemen,” added he, turning to the two friends, “will, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?” “But, my dear count,” said Albert, “we shall abuse your kindness.” “Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"You will, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the mazzolata still remains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is very simple.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Ah,” added the count, in a contemptuous tone, “do not tell me of European punishments, they are in the infancy, or rather the old age, of cruelty.” “Really, count,” replied Franz, “one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world.” “There are, at least, few that I have not seen,” said the count coldly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?” “My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third curiosity.” “Curiosity—that is a terrible word.” “Why so?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not then, curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part; and how, according to their different characters, temperaments, and even the different customs of their countries, different persons bear the transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"As for myself, I can assure you of one thing,—the more men you see die, the easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a torture, but it is not an expiation.” “I do not quite understand you,” replied Franz; “pray explain your meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.” “Listen,” said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face, as the blood would to the face of any other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“If a man had by unheard-of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your betrothed,—a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound that never closes, in your breast,—do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?” “Yes, I know,” said Franz, “that human justice is insufficient to console us; she can give blood in return for blood, that is all; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant.” “I will put another case to you,” continued the count; “that where society, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Are there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers of the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are inadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Answer me, do not these crimes exist?” “Yes,” answered Franz; “and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated.” “Ah, duelling,” cried the count; “a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"A man has carried off your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass a sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your brain, and despair in your heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Oh, yes,” replied the count; “understand me, I would fight a duel for a trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have gradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Oh, I would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound, eternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,—our masters in everything,—those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities.” “But,” said Franz to the count, “with this theory, which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.” “Yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and skilful; besides, the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic French Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35.

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Ah, I recollect, you asked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sit down to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready.” As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment, saying: “Al suo commodo!” The two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"During the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz looked repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him, whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which Franz knew of had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of Italian cookery—that is, the worst in the world.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"As for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Well,” said the count, “what are you doing?” “You must excuse us, count,” returned Franz, “but we have still much to do.” “What may that be?” “We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.” “Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room in the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us, and you can dress there.” “After the execution?” cried Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Before or after, whichever you please.” “Opposite the scaffold?” “The scaffold forms part of the fête.” “Count, I have reflected on the matter,” said Franz, “I thank you for your courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.” “But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,” returned the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"Think what a figure you will make when you are asked, ‘How do they execute at Rome?’ and you reply, ‘I do not know!’ And, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata,"“Ma foi, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count’s eloquence decides me.” “Let us go, then,” said Franz, “since you wish it; but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 35.

Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent, and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced towards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"“Well,” said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of his countenance disturbed, “well, my dear Vampa, it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.” 20207m “Ground arms,” exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the hand, while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then, turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said, “Your pardon, your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit, that I did not really recognize you.” “It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,” said the count, “and that not only do you forget people’s faces, but also the conditions you make with them.” “What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?” inquired the bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is anxious to repair it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"“Was it not agreed,” asked the count, “that not only my person, but also that of my friends, should be respected by you?” “And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?” “You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Viscount Albert de Morcerf.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"Well,” continued the count, in a tone that made Franz shudder, “this young gentleman is one of my friends—this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself—this young gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither, and,” added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, “you have set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.” “Why did you not tell me all this—you?” inquired the brigand chief, turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"“Welcome among us, your excellency,” he said to him; “you heard what the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend’s ransom, that this had happened.” “But,” said Franz, looking round him uneasily, “where is the viscount?—I do not see him.” “Nothing has happened to him, I hope,” said the count frowningly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"“The prisoner is there,” replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard, “and I will go myself and tell him he is free.” The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albert’s prison, and Franz and the count followed him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 37.

Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"“You are right, your excellency,” he said; “this must be one of your friends.” Then going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, “Will your excellency please to awaken?” Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"“What,” said he, “is it you, my dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?” “No, not I,” replied Franz, “but our neighbor, the Count of Monte Cristo.” “Oh, my dear count,” said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and wristbands, “you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the carriage, and in the next for this visit,” and he put out his hand to the count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did give it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian,"The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz, he was enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 37.

Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Franz, who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Albert’s request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"“My dear count,” said Albert, advancing to meet him, “permit me to repeat the poor thanks I offered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as I live, I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life.” “My very good friend and excellent neighbor,” replied the count, with a smile, “you really exaggerate my trifling exertions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between us;—but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.” “Upon my word,” said Albert, “I deserve no credit for what I could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

The Rendezvous,"My father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my life is dear, at your disposal.” “Monsieur de Morcerf,” replied the count, “your offer, far from surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;—nay, I will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands.” “Oh, pray name it.” “I am wholly a stranger to Paris—it is a city I have never yet seen.” “Is it possible,” exclaimed Albert, “that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"I can scarcely credit it.” “Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all probability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty, as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the idea.” “So distinguished an individual as yourself,” cried Albert, “could scarcely have required an introduction.” “You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I possess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in the speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Your offer, however, smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de Morcerf” (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile), “whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or a native of Cochin-China?” “Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,” answered Albert; “and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and connected with the very cream of Parisian society.” “Connected by marriage, you mean,” said Franz, laughingly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"“But tell me now, count,” exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; “tell me truly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?” “I pledge you my honor,” returned the count, “that I mean to do as I have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris.” “When do you propose going thither?” “Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?” “Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks’ time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!” “Nay,” said the Count; “I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"“And in three months’ time,” said Albert, “you will be at my house?” “Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?” inquired the count; “only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.” “Day for day, hour for hour,” said Albert; “that will suit me to a dot.” “So be it, then,” replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, “today is the 21st of February;” and drawing out his watch, added, “it is exactly half-past ten o’clock.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Why, you must have lost your senses.” “Whether I am in my senses or not,” answered Franz, “that is the way I feel.” “Listen to me, Franz,” said Albert; “I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has always been courtesy itself to us.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves, but purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to Corsica, my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect, should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to find them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly.” “Still,” persisted Franz, “I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?” “My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its source; therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws, you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my own idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me 4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less than 24,000 livres of our money—a sum at which, most assuredly, I should never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,” added Albert with a laugh, “that no prophet is honored in his own country.” “Talking of countries,” replied Franz, “of what country is the count, what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune, and what were those events of his early life—a life as marvellous as unknown—that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"My good fellow, you must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such cold-blooded policy.” And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments were all on Albert’s side.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"“Well,” said Franz with a sigh, “do as you please my dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage.” “He is a philanthropist,” answered the other; “and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"If my vote and interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter’s?” Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o’clock, the young men parted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d’Épinay to pass a fortnight at Venice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 38. The Rendezvous,"But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil: “27, Rue du Helder, on the 21st May, half-past ten A.M.”",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the occasion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 39. The Guests,"Between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcerf.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"A high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"A small door, close to the lodge of the concierge, gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling to part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount’s age required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this habitation for Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent, careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"By means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see all that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men, who always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Then, should anything appear to merit a more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the concierge’s door, and which merits a particular description.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"This door was a mockery to the concierge, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free, and, like that famous portal in the Arabian Nights, opening at the “Sesame” of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and which formed the antechamber, was, on the right, Albert’s breakfast- room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into the garden.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third, formed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon, a boudoir, and a bedroom.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan, for the use of smokers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident that every precaution had been taken.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Above this floor was a large atelier, which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions—a pandemonium, in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"There were collected and piled up all Albert’s successive caprices, hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes—a whole orchestra, for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes, pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves, broadswords, and single-sticks—for, following the example of the fashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with far more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that complete a dandy’s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick; and it was here that he received Grisier, Cooks, and Charles Leboucher.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della Robbia faïences, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which perhaps had sat Henry IV.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"or Sully, Louis XIII.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"or Richelieu—for two of these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field, evidently came from the Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed beneath Persia’s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta or of Chandernagor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet “baby grand” piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs-d’œuvre of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Grétry, and Porpora.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers, Malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,This was Albert’s favorite lounging place.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 39. The Guests,"There, on a table, surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco known,—from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai, and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,—was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond; beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an open cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their long tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert’s establishment, although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great occasions the count’s chasseur also.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"This valet, whose name was Germain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master, held in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters, which he gave to Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some attention.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 39. The Guests,"Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to the minister—and besides” (Albert looked at his tablets), “it is the hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Is the countess up yet?” “If you wish, I will inquire.” “Yes, ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets, mine is incomplete; and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o’clock, and that I request permission to introduce someone to her.” The valet left the room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre announcements, made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet; hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of which he had heard, and threw down, one after the other, the three leading papers of Paris, muttering, “These papers become more and more stupid every day.” A moment after, a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant announced M. Lucien Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air, without smiling or speaking.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 39. The Guests,"We take him to the other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at Bourges.” “At Bourges?” “Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of Charles VII.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 39. The Guests,"Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day before it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do) made a million!” “And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your button- hole.” “Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,” returned Debray carelessly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“No, the sacrifice,” returned Château-Renaud; “ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?” “Not for a stranger,” said Debray, “but for a friend I might, perhaps.” “I divined that you would become mine, count,” replied Morrel; “besides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.” “The history to which M. Morrel alludes,” continued Château-Renaud, “is an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our memories.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table—at least, I hope so—two benefactors of humanity.” “What shall we do?” said Debray; “we have only one Monthyon prize.” “Well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it,” said Beauchamp; “that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the dilemma.” “And where does he come from?” asked Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“You have already answered the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second time.” “Really,” said Albert, “I do not know; when I invited him three months ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may have gone?” “And you think him capable of being exact?” demanded Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“I think him capable of everything.” “Well, with the five minutes’ grace, we have only ten left.” “I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.” “I beg pardon,” interrupted Beauchamp; “are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us?” “Yes, and for a most curious one.” “Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning, and I must make up for it.” “I was at Rome during the last Carnival.” “We know that,” said Beauchamp.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Morrel comes to aid me; you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth?” “My dear Albert,” said Debray, “what you tell us is so extraordinary.” “Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them—they have no time.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

The Breakfast,"You were no stranger to me, for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"I will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit, as you term him?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word.” “I will keep it,” returned Morcerf; “but I fear that you will be much disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our Chimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valérien, our Great Desert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"We have plenty of thieves, though not so many as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will not find in its eighty-five departments—I say eighty-five, because I do not include Corsica—you will not find, then, in these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"There is but one service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely at your orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you everywhere; besides, you have no need of anyone to introduce you—with your name, and your fortune, and your talent” (Monte Cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile) “you can present yourself everywhere, and be well received.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"I can be useful in one way only—if knowledge of Parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I shared yours at Rome—I, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist par excellence; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow more, unless that shadow were feminine.” “Ah,” said the count, “that is a most conjugal reservation; I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"May I congratulate you?” “The affair is still in projection.” “And he who says in ‘projection,’ means already decided,” said Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“No,” replied Morcerf, “my father is most anxious about it; and I hope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my betrothed—Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.” “Eugénie Danglars,” said Monte Cristo; “tell me, is not her father Baron Danglars?” “Yes,” returned Morcerf, “a baron of a new creation.” “What matter,” said Monte Cristo “if he has rendered the State services which merit this distinction?” “Enormous ones,” answered Beauchamp.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“Although in reality a Liberal, he negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his button-hole.” “Ah,” interrupted Morcerf, laughing, “Beauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that for the Corsaire or the Charivari, but spare my future father-in-law before me.” Then, turning to Monte Cristo, “You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron?” “I do not know him,” returned Monte Cristo; “but I shall probably soon make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house of Richard & Blount, of London, Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, and Thomson & French at Rome.” As he pronounced the two last names, the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"If the stranger expected to produce an effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken—Maximilian started as if he had been electrified.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“The count will find there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.” “Bah!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Château-Renaud,” returned Debray, “you only know your dull and gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to him, count—live in the Chaussée d’Antin, that’s the real centre of Paris.” “Boulevard de l’Opéra,” said Beauchamp; “the second floor—a house with a balcony.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him.” “You have no idea, then, Morrel?” asked Château-Renaud; “you do not propose anything.” “Oh, yes,” returned the young man, smiling; “on the contrary, I have one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue Meslay.” “You have a sister?” asked the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.” “Married?” “Nearly nine years.” “Happy?” asked the count again.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40.

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch of him.” 20255m “Oh, no,” said Morrel; “my sister is five-and-twenty, my brother-in-law is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Besides, the count will be in his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.” “Thanks, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo; “I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.” “What,” cried Morcerf; “you are, then, going to a hotel—that will be very dull for you.” “Was I so badly lodged at Rome?” said Monte Cristo smiling.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,“Parbleu!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day.” “It is not that which deterred me,” replied Monte Cristo; “but as I determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre, and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.” “But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?” said Beauchamp.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,“It is the first time he has ever been in Paris.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.” “Certainly,” said Morcerf; “I recollect him perfectly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?—he will do everything wrong.” “Undeceive yourself, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I am quite sure, that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“What, do you not know your house?” asked Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“No,” said Monte Cristo; “I told you I did not wish to be behind my time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount’s door.” The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false—besides, why should he tell a falsehood?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“We must content ourselves, then,” said Beauchamp, “with rendering the count all the little services in our power.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"I, in my quality of journalist, open all the theatres to him.” “Thanks, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo, “my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre.” “Is your steward also a Nubian?” asked Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"But you know him, M. de Morcerf.” “Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so well?” “Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been a soldier, a smuggler—in fact, everything.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle—a stab with a knife, for instance.” “And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,” said Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"“Of how much does he rob you every year?” “On my word,” replied the count, “not more than another.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"I am sure he answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.” “Then,” continued Château-Renaud, “since you have an establishment, a steward, and a hotel in the Champs-Élysées, you only want a mistress.” Albert smiled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the Variétés; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but I have nothing to fear.” “But you forget,” replied Debray, laughing, “that we are Franks by name and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free.” “Who will tell her?” “The first person who sees her.” “She only speaks Romaic.” “That is different.” “But at least we shall see her,” said Beauchamp, “or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes?” “Oh, no,” replied Monte Cristo; “I do not carry brutalism so far.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.” They had long since passed to dessert and cigars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Au revoir, Albert.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 40. The Breakfast,"Gentlemen, good morning.” As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, “My carriage.” “Bravo,” said Beauchamp to Albert; “I shall not go to the Chamber, but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M.

Chapter 41. The Presentation,They descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest into the salon.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 41. The Presentation,"The salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were landscapes by Dupré, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing oxen and marvellous skies; Delacroix’s Arabian cavaliers, with their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces; aquarelles of Boulanger, representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the sun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa, but more poetic; pastels by Giraud and Müller, representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from the album of Dauzats’ “Travels in the East,” that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 41. The Presentation,"Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking for the signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 41. The Presentation,The countess had this portrait painted during the count’s absence.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 41.

Chapter 41. The Presentation,"One of your ancestors had joined the Crusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.” “It is possible,” said Morcerf; “my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made commentaries that would have greatly edified d’Hozier and Jaucourt.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 41.

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not deceived.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"Three hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed, and two minutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened the little door of the garden, which he closed after him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I descended rapidly; although I had not seen Villefort’s face, I recognized him by the beating of my heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I crossed the street, and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall, and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"“This time I did not content myself with looking, but I took my knife out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and sprang over the wall.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"Nothing, then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the grounds.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"The garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44.

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I fancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your excellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"When he was only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I was still unable to divine for what reason M. de Villefort had this spade in his hands, when he stopped close to the thicket where I was, glanced round, and began to dig a hole in the earth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle, which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"Then, I confess, curiosity mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there, and I remained motionless, holding my breath.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"Then an idea crossed my mind, which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box, two feet long, and six or eight inches deep.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I let him place the box in the hole he had made, then, while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast, exclaiming: “‘I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my brother’s; thy treasure for his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped.’ “I know not if he heard these words; I think he did not, for he fell without a cry.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"I felt his blood gush over my face, but I was intoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood refreshed, instead of burning me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"In a second I had disinterred the box; then, that it might not be known I had done so, I filled up the hole, threw the spade over the wall, and rushed through the door, which I double-locked, carrying off the key.” “Ah,” said Monte Cristo “it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery.” “No, your excellency,” returned Bertuccio; “it was a vendetta followed by restitution.” “And was the sum a large one?” “It was not money.” “Ah, I recollect,” replied the count; “did you not say something of an infant?” “Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and with my knife forced open the lock of the box.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart, and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a doctor would have done—I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them, and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and cried feebly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"“‘God has not cursed me then,’ I cried, ‘since he permits me to save the life of a human creature, in exchange for the life I have taken away.’” 20295m “And what did you do with the child?” asked Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"“It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.” “I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"As I passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum, which was situated at the upper end of the Rue d’Enfer, and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child, while the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and fled with all speed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"A fortnight after I was at Rogliano, and I said to Assunta: “‘Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.’ “She demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,—‘Giovanni,’ said she, ‘you should have brought this child with you; we would have replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then, in consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.’ In reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich.” “What letters were marked on the linen?” said Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"“An H and an N, surmounted by a baron’s coronet.” “By heaven, M.

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"for I think you told me it was a boy, M. Bertuccio.” “No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.” “I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.” “No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"But your excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?” “The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor, and the Abbé Busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at Nîmes.” “The story will be very long, excellency.” “What matter?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either.” Bertuccio bowed, and resumed his story.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"Since my brother’s assassination in the streets of Nîmes, I had never entered the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to come to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 44. The Vendetta,"Smuggling is a profitable trade, when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for myself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the past.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"You have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun to accumulate—let it continue to do so.” This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved, produced an effect on M.

Chapter 46.

Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"As he passed them he said: “They are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.” “Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.” “Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,” inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered with gold.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“You will, I trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you,” he said, “but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people.” “So much so,” replied Monte Cristo, “that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count.” “Upon my word, monsieur,” said Danglars with affected carelessness, “I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return for services rendered, but——” “But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"That was a noble example to follow, monsieur.” “Why,” replied Danglars, “not entirely so; with the servants,—you understand.” “I see; to your domestics you are ‘my lord,’ the journalists style you ‘monsieur,’ while your constituents call you ‘citizen.’ These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"I understand perfectly.” Again Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“Permit me to inform you, Count,” said he, bowing, “that I have received a letter of advice from Thomson & French, of Rome.” “I am glad to hear it, baron,—for I must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,I have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"But as regards the letter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"You have received a regular letter of advice?” “Yes,” said Danglars, “but I confess I didn’t quite comprehend its meaning.” “Indeed?” “And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in order to beg for an explanation.” “Go on, monsieur.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you desire.” “Why,” said Danglars, “in the letter—I believe I have it about me”—here he felt in his breast-pocket—“yes, here it is.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"Well, this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house.” “Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?” “Merely the term unlimited—nothing else, certainly.” “Is not that word known in France?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"The people who wrote are Anglo- Germans, you know.” “Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said; but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have doubts.” “Is it possible?” asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,“Is it possible that Thomson & French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"Pray tell me what you think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some considerable property in their hands.” “Thomson & French are perfectly solvent,” replied Danglars, with an almost mocking smile; “but the word unlimited, in financial affairs, is so extremely vague.” “Is, in fact, unlimited,” said Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“Precisely what I was about to say,” cried Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“Now what is vague is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, ‘when in doubt, keep out.’” “Meaning to say,” rejoined Monte Cristo, “that however Thomson & French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example.” “Not at all.” “Plainly enough; Messrs. Thomson & French set no bounds to their engagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise man, according to his own showing.” “Monsieur,” replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air, “the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.” “It seems, then, reserved for me,” said Monte Cristo coldly, “to be the first to do so.” “By what right, sir?” “By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.” Once more Danglars bit his lips.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"It was the second time he had been worsted, and this time on his own ground.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"Monte Cristo on the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus possessed the advantage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“Well, sir,” resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, “I will endeavor to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me?” “Why, truly,” replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained, “my reason for desiring an ‘unlimited’ credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.” The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"So throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and purse-proud air: “Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars, however limited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you even to require a million——” “I beg your pardon,” interposed Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“I said a million,” replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,“But could I do with a million?” retorted the count.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms.” The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely vanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“Oh, sir,” said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,—“three letters of unlimited credit!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.” “Nay,” answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, “’tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?” “Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.” “Why,” replied Monte Cristo, “since we mutually understand each other—for such I presume is the case?” Danglars bowed assentingly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"“You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind?” “Oh, my dear count,” exclaimed Danglars, “I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you.” “No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to——” “Six millions!” gasped Danglars—“so be it.” “Then, if I should require more,” continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner, “why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit,"For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars—excuse my impatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member of the family.” Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered honor; Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglars—a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white Indian muslin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher; and at each side pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The truth was, it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M.

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"M. Danglars, however, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it was understood during the time of the Directory, entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife’s favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than that of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or frigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

The Dappled Grays,"Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?” “I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement.” “Are you fond of horses, count?” “I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things—the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.” “Nay, count,” said the baroness, “it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.” “You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.” At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed: “I cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.” “I assure you, madame,” replied the woman, “it is as I have said.” Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, “Is this true?” “Is what true, madame?” inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“What my maid tells me.” “But what does she tell you?” “That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"I desire to know what is the meaning of this?” “Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,” said Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will give.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"These two gentlemen shall decide between us; but, first, I will state the case to them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Gentlemen,” continued the baroness, “among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars, are two that belong exclusively to me—a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"But to you, at least, M. Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Well, I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone—positively gone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!” “Madame,” replied Danglars, “the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely uneasy on your account.” “Nonsense,” retorted the baroness; “you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"But, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?” “My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and steady.” The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt, while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture, turned towards Monte Cristo and said,—“Upon my word, count, I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"You are setting up an establishment, of course?” “Why, yes,” replied the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"I have almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"They were only fit for a young man.” “I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,” said Monte Cristo; “but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriage- horses, and I do not think they were dear.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,There they are.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Come, M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your opinion upon them.” As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars approached his wife.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“I could not tell you before others,” said he in a low tone, “the reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Some madman or fool, bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000 francs by the sale of them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,Wasn’t I right to part with the horses?” Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“What is it?” asked the baroness.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“I cannot believe it,” murmured the banker.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo, saying, “The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.” “I scarcely know,” replied the count; “it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward, and cost me—well, somewhere about 30,000 francs.” Debray conveyed the count’s reply to the baroness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,Poor Danglars looked so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Your kind attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"But so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Therefore, in my opinion, my dear baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows, why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.” Danglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of Olympic Jove, predicted a storm.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Debray, who perceived the gathering clouds, and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars’ rage, suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take his leave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and departed, leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"But,” he went on with his peculiar smile, “I am here in Paris, and have plenty of time before me—by and by will do for that.” With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Two hours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite “dappled grays,” protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman’s regrets.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning; only, by the count’s orders, in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had been fastened a large diamond.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The following day, about three o’clock, a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“Ali,” observed his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, “you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso, have you not?” Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a sign in the affirmative.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“I thought I did not mistake.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,With your lasso you could stop an ox?” Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“Or a tiger?” Ali bowed his head in token of assent.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“A lion even?” Ali sprung forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a strangled lion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“I understand,” said Monte Cristo; “you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion?” Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury?” The Nubian smiled.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,“Then listen to me.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Ere long a carriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must manage to stop those horses before my door.” Ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count, who was watching him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The count patted him gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo re- entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Still, as five o’clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"He stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild, ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other’s arms.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,Terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road, and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket, threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from his box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse, and held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain, sunk beside his companion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The brief space had, however, been sufficient for a man, followed by a number of servants, to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman opened the door of the carriage, to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand, while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy, who had lost consciousness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“I understand the nature of your alarms, madame,” said the count, carefully examining the child, “but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has not received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror, and will soon pass.” “Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Oh, sir, in pity send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy.” With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass incrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which he let fall a single drop on the child’s lips.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Scarcely had it reached them, ere the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his eyes, and eagerly gazed around him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“Where am I?” exclaimed she; “and to whom am I indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm?” “Madame,” answered the count, “you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings.” “My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,” pursued the lady.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars’ beautiful horses, and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them.” “Is it possible,” exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment, “that these horses belong to the baroness?” “They do, indeed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame Danglars?” 20351m “I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands.” “You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom Hermine has talked to me so much?” “You have rightly guessed, madame,” replied the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant, this dear child and myself must both have perished.” “Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.” “I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man.” “I beseech you, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “not to spoil Ali, either by too great praise or rewards.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,I cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me.” “Nay,” interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression, “nay, but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own.” “His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my having myself saved him from death.” Madame de Villefort made no further reply; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who, from the first instant she saw him, had made so powerful an impression on her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort, Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms, lavishing on him the most tender endearments.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"The child was small for his age, and unnaturally pale.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"A mass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"His mouth was large, and the lips, which had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child’s face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“Touch nothing, my little friend,” cried the count eagerly; “some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.” Madame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son’s arm, drew him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost upon the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,At this moment Ali entered.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Thank him, then, my child, in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid, neither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks.” The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner, saying, “He’s too ugly.” 20353m The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“This lady,” said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic language, “is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.” Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“Will you permit me to inquire,” said Madame de Villefort, as she arose to take her leave, “whether you usually reside here?” “No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo; “it is a small place I have purchased quite lately.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"As soon as that important business is concluded, I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars.” “I dare not return with those dreadful horses,” said Madame de Villefort.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"“You will see,” replied Monte Cristo, “that they will be as different as possible in the hands of Ali.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"With him they will be gentle and docile as lambs.” Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"Then, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count’s chariot, took the reins in his hands, and mounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated “dappled grays,” now changed into a couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace, kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays,"20355m Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:— “Dear Hermine,—I have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see today.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 48. Ideology,"If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which M. de Villefort had taken.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Standing well at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch, whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly supported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de Villefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained his eminence like a Harlay or a Molé.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"His drawing-room, under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"A freezing politeness, a strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,—these were the elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"30023m M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"His relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with dignity and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so many things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but sometimes consulted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"This fortress was his post as king’s attorney, all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"His wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of professed superiority—in fact, the application of the axiom, Pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the Greeks, “Know thyself,” a knowledge for which, in our days, we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies, he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the one nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He had a haughty bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,Four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in France.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He gave a ball every year, at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only,—that is to say, five-and-forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He was never seen at the theatres, at concerts, or in any place of public resort.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Occasionally, but seldom, he played at whist, and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him—sometimes they were ambassadors, sometimes archbishops, or sometimes a prince, or a president, or some dowager duchess.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte Cristo’s door.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 48. Ideology,The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 48. Ideology,"From being slender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his deep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He dressed entirely in black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Although master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and who, distrustful by habit, and especially incredulous as to social prodigies, was much more despised to look upon “the noble stranger,” as Monte Cristo was already called, as an adventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than as a prince of the Holy See, or a sultan of the Thousand and One Nights.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Sir,” said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest themselves in society, “sir, the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude.” And as he said this, the “eye severe” of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He spoke in a voice of the procureur-general, with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say (as we have before observed) that he was the living statue of the law.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Monsieur,” replied the count, with a chilling air, “I am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great honor; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me,—a favor which, however estimable, is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness.” Villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected, started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"He saw the map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered, and said: “You seem geographically engaged, sir?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It is a rich study for you, who, as I learn, have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map.” “Yes, sir,” replied the count; “I have sought to make of the human race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals—a physiological study.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,I have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It is an algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg of you.” Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,—a conversation which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Ah, you philosophize,” replied Villefort, after a moment’s silence, during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took breath; “well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do, I should seek a more amusing occupation.” “Why, in truth, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s reply, “man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you said, I think, that I had nothing else to do.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Now, really, let me ask, sir, have you?—do you believe you have anything to do?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"or to speak in plain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything?” Villefort’s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly, it was the first time he had ever heard of it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,The procureur exerted himself to reply.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Sir,” he responded, “you are a stranger, and I believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental countries, so you are not aware how human justice, so expeditious in barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and well-studied course.” “Oh, yes—yes, I do, sir; it is the pede claudo of the ancients.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I have occupied myself—it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that it is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation, that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God.” “If this law were adopted, sir,” said the procureur, “it would greatly simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as you just observed) have much to do.” “It may, perhaps, come to this in time,” observed Monte Cristo; “you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and simplicity is always perfection.” “In the meanwhile,” continued the magistrate, “our codes are in full force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which, you will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong power of brain to retain it.” “I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with respect to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code, but as regards the codes of all nations.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"The English, Turkish, Japanese, Hindu laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and thus I was right, when I said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is relative, sir)—that relatively to what I have done, you have very little to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you have yet a great deal to learn.” “But with what motive have you learned all this?” inquired Villefort, in astonishment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,Monte Cristo smiled.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Really, sir,” he observed, “I see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending with man—that is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace.” “Pray, sir, explain yourself,” said Villefort, more and more astonished, “I really do—not—understand you—perfectly.” “I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to follow out, instead of a post to fill—I say that they escape your narrow, limited field of observation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It is thus that human weakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,Tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"The nations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one was compelled to say, ‘I am the angel of the Lord’; and the other, ‘I am the hammer of God,’ in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed.” “Then,” said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman, “you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?” “And why not?” said Monte Cristo coldly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Your pardon, sir,” replied Villefort, quite astounded, “but you will excuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was unaware that I should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune—at least, so it is said—and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely repeat;—it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world.” “Really, sir,” retorted the count, “have you attained the eminent situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without having met with exceptions?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"and do you never use your eyes, which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty, to divine, at a glance, the kind of man by whom you are confronted?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy?” “Sir,” said Villefort, “upon my word, you overcome me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I really never heard a person speak as you do.” “Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.” “And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?” “Why should they not?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without which you could not for a moment exist?” “Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?” “Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a material form.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to them, and they reply to you.” “Ah,” said Villefort, smiling, “I confess I should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me.” “You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just now, and I now again warn you.” “Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?” “Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in a position similar to mine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"The dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of language.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard—I am a cosmopolite.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 48. Ideology,"Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab; Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Haydée, my slave, thinks me a Greek.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country, asking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man as my brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the obstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I have only two adversaries—I will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I subdue even them,—they are time and distance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"There is a third, and the most terrible—that is my condition as a mortal being.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 48. Ideology,"What men call the chances of fate—namely, ruin, change, circumstances—I have fully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it will not overwhelm me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Unless I die, I shall always be what I am, and therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard, even from the mouths of kings—for kings have need, and other persons have fear of you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as incongruously organized as ours, ‘Perhaps some day I shall have to do with the king’s attorney’?” “But can you not say that, sir?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"The moment you become an inhabitant of France, you are naturally subjected to the French law.” “I know it sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “but when I visit a country I begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as, perhaps better than, they know themselves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It follows from this, that the king’s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal, would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.” “That is to say,” replied Villefort with hesitation, “that human nature being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.” “Faults or crimes,” responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers—for you have said so,” observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat—“you alone are perfect.” “No, not perfect,” was the count’s reply; “only impenetrable, that’s all.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second-sight.” “No, no,—by no means,” said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“No; by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no longer talk, we rise to dissertation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"But you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies, occasionally say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to you, rude as it may seem, ‘My brother, you sacrifice greatly to pride; you may be above others, but above you there is God.’” 30029m “Above us all, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s response, in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,“I have my pride for men—serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"But I lay aside that pride before God, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.” “Then, count, I admire you,” said Villefort, who, for the first time in this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Yes, and I say to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious, or impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing—then be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of predominance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Yet you have unquestionably some ambition.” “I have, sir.” “And what may it be?” “I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to me, ‘Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?’ I reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then I replied, ‘Listen,—I have always heard of Providence, and yet I have never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make me believe that he exists.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.’ Satan bowed his head, and groaned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"‘You mistake,’ he said, ‘Providence does exist, only you have never seen him, because the child of God is as invisible as the parent.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"You have seen nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs, and moves by hidden ways.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that Providence.’ The bargain was concluded.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I may sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?” added Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“If the thing were to do again, I would again do it.” Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Count,” he inquired, “have you any relations?” “No, sir, I am alone in the world.” “So much the worse.” “Why?” asked Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,“Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"You say you fear nothing but death?” “I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans.” “And old age?” “My end will be achieved before I grow old.” “And madness?” “I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,—non bis in idem.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"It is an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full application.” 30031m “Sir,” continued Villefort, “there is something to fear besides death, old age, and madness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"For instance, there is apoplexy—that lightning- stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which brings everything to an end.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"You are still yourself as now, and yet you are yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are but an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this is called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than apoplexy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation at my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father, M. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity, seconded by a most powerful organization—a man who has not, perhaps, like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of Providence, but of fate.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 48. Ideology,"Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning poor M. Noirtier, the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay.” “Alas, sir,” said Monte Cristo “this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I am something of a physician, and have, like my fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes, although present to my heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca, St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison you have made, and yet I can well understand that a father’s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"I will call on you, sir, since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family.” “It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a compensation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to the tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine, the daughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran—and Edward, the boy whose life you have this day saved.” “And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?” inquired Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“My deduction is,” replied Villefort, “that my father, led away by his passions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked by the justice of God.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but one person, has visited this justice on him alone.” Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"“Adieu, sir,” said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; “I leave you, bearing a remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem, which I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I am not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"Besides, you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.” The count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with every mark of attention.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 48. Ideology,"When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said: “Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.” Then sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered: “I am going to madame’s chamber—have the carriage ready at one o’clock.”",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"It will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits—the bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged, illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness, as, immediately after Villefort’s departure, his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"Even Ali, who had hastened to obey the Count’s summons, went forth from his master’s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron’s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master’s happy reverie.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"It was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of Haydée, as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"The rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were covered with the richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture; while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and yielding cushions, that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"Haydée had three French maids, and one who was a Greek.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,"The first three remained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave, who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistress’s wishes to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 49. Haydée,The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 50. The Morrel Family,"“What did your father tell you, M. Morrel?” said he eagerly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 50. The Morrel Family,“My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 50. The Morrel Family,"Oh, it was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father’s faith.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 50. The Morrel Family,"How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend—a friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but a doubt, became a conviction, and his last words were, ‘Maximilian, it was Edmond Dantès!’” At these words the count’s paleness, which had for some time been increasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words to Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and Maximilian,—“Madame,” said he, “I trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for your welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have thus yielded to my feelings;” and he hastily quitted the apartment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 50. The Morrel Family,"“This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,” said Emmanuel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 50. The Morrel Family,"“Yes,” answered Maximilian, “but I feel sure he has an excellent heart, and that he likes us.” “His voice went to my heart,” observed Julie; “and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it before.”",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the wide- spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that dated from the time of Louis XIII.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted courtyard, opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"For the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honoré itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"In matters of speculation, however, though “man proposes,” yet “money disposes.” From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high price for it, and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a yearly rental of 500 francs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"And so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"True, the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas, and melons had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"A small, low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one-half per cent it had originally paid.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"Towards the house the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall, without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"At one corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces off.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks,—the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man appeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"After casting a rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume, the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty retreat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and observed the fluttering of the blue sash.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"Pressing his lips close to the planks, he exclaimed: “Don’t be alarmed, Valentine—it is I!” Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she did so: “And why do you come so late today?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"It is almost dinner-time, and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to get done.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you.” “Dearest Valentine,” said the young man, “the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love, but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"If it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose), at least I was in your thoughts.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"You asked me the cause of my being late, and why I come disguised.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"That would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted the costume of my calling.” “What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!” “Nonsense?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"We should presume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind confidence in each other’s prudence.” “How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear Valentine?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 51.

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure anything.” “Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my mother- in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings, so fraught with danger to both.” “I will not admit that word,” returned the young man; “it is at once cruel and unjust.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Pyramus and Thisbe,"Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my father’s commands it is more on your account than my own.” “But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,—why picture so gloomy a future?” “Because I judge it from the past.” “Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what is termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not altogether so much beneath your alliance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 51.

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the Legion of Honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M.

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.” “‘Morrel, Morrel,’ cried my father, ‘stop a bit;’ then knitting his brows into a deep frown, he added, ‘surely this cannot be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from their violent Bonapartism—I mean about the year 1815.’ “‘Yes,’ replied M.

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"“‘Ah,’ continued my father, still frowning, ‘their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them ‘food for cannon,’ which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 51.

Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"But what did M. Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?” “Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself—half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation of my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe,"And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner.” “The name of M. Noirtier,” interposed Maximilian, “is celebrated throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the Bourbons.” “Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange—the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort,"“Sir,” said he, “you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort,"Nevertheless, you have not been forgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that Valentine’s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should live with them; so that you and Valentine, who are so attached to each other, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you two children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.” 30165m Noirtier’s look was furious; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man’s mind, for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance, appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort,"Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is very warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to his place, but did not sit down.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort,"“This marriage,” added Madame de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the wishes of M. d’Épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and his father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he was but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.” “That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort, “and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person.” Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort,"“Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace- offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64. The Beggar,"He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"While Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Château-Renaud, and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort’s carriage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had offered him a seat in his carriage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the English fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad, and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people, amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king’s attorney.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Then he had been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the stiff- necked old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major’s little finger; for the major, like a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Then, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son, previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker’s servants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"One thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the veneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"The latter, faithful to the principle of Horace, nil admirari, had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Then he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore, concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro, and the sterlet from the Volga.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words: “Tomorrow, sir, I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business.” “And I, sir,” said Danglars, “shall be most happy to receive you.” Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel des Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and carriages, and that not having come together, it would not be difficult for them to leave separately.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"The major seated himself, therefore, by the side of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"As for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom, who, instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had taken it to the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"The groom heard him with humility, took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held out the reins to Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished boot lightly on the step.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,At that moment a hand touched his shoulder.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"The young man turned round, thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him, and had returned just as they were starting.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"But instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face, sunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles, and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth, pointed and sharp as the wolf’s or jackal’s.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"A red handkerchief encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man’s shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw, seemed of gigantic size.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"30229m Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,We cannot say; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,“What do you want of me?” he asked.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,” said the man with the red handkerchief, “but I want to speak to you.” “You have no right to beg at night,” said the groom, endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“I am not begging, my fine fellow,” said the unknown to the servant, with so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile, that he withdrew; “I only wish to say two or three words to your master, who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.” “Come,” said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation, “what do you want?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Speak quickly, friend.” The man said, in a low voice: “I wish—I wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you, I can scarcely stand.” The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Tell me,” he said—“tell me what you want?” “Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry me back.” Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Yes,” said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking impudently at the youth; “I have taken the whim into my head; do you understand, Master Benedetto?” At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went towards his groom, saying: “This man is right; I did indeed charge him with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.” The surprised groom retired.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Let me at least reach a shady spot,” said Andrea.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Oh, as for that, I’ll take you to a splendid place,” said the man with the handkerchief; and taking the horse’s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Don’t think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage,” said he; “oh, no, it’s only because I am tired, and also because I have a little business to talk over with you.” “Come, step in,” said the young man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though well- pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Once out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man, he asked: “Now, tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity?” “Let me ask you why you deceived me?” “How have I deceived you?” “‘How,’ do you ask?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that, you come to Paris.” “How does that annoy you?” “It does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose.” “So,” said Andrea, “you are speculating upon me?” “What fine words he uses!” “I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.” “Well, well, don’t be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64. The Beggar,"You know I always did call you my child.” “Come, come, what then?” “Patience—patience!” “I am patient, but go on.” “All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a tilbury, and fine new clothes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"You must have discovered a mine, or else become a stockbroker.” “So that, as you confess, you are jealous?” “No, I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as I am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might not compromise you.” “Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!” exclaimed Andrea; “you speak to me before my servant.” “How can I help that, my boy?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,I speak to you when I can catch you.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"You have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as an eel; if I had missed you tonight, I might not have had another chance.” “You see, I do not conceal myself.” “You are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself; and then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,” added Caderousse with his unpleasant smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“It was very polite of you.” “Come,” said Andrea, “what do you want?” “You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that is not right—take care, or I may become troublesome.” This menace smothered the young man’s passion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,He urged the horse again into a trot.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“You should not speak so to an old friend like me, Caderousse, as you said just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I am——” “Do you know then now what you are?” “No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I am young and wilful.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Between people like us threats are out of place, everything should be amicably arranged.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“If I had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet, you would not have known me.” “You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being as well-dressed as anyone, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64. The Beggar,"I have no design upon your count, and you shall have him all to yourself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"But,” said Caderousse, again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed, “you must pay for it—you understand?” “Well, what do you want?” “I think that with a hundred francs a month——” “Well?” “I could live——” “Upon a hundred francs!” “Come—you understand me; but that with——” “With?” “With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.” “Here are two hundred,” said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64. The Beggar,"“Apply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will receive the same sum.” “There now, again you degrade me.” “How so?” “By making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business with you alone.” “Well, be it so, then.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Take it from me then, and so long at least as I receive my income, you shall be paid yours.” “Come, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Meanwhile, what are you going to do?” “I?” “Yes, you.” “It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.” “Since you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn to ask you some questions.” “Ah, true.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear a decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a café.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

The Beggar,"Not at all?” “Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head, with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket, without reckoning what was there before—making in all about two hundred francs,—why, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 64. The Beggar,"Then, to justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this would cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the Mediterranean.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 64.

Matrimonial Projects,"I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a wife.” “Do you think so?” “I am sure of it.” “And you have heard his fortune mentioned?” “Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and others that he did not possess a farthing.” “And what is your opinion?” “I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal impression.” “Well, and it is that——” “My opinion is, that all these old podestàs, these ancient condottieri,—for the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces,—my opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions in corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have become reflected in them.” “Certainly,” said Danglars, “and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land.” “Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses, excepting his palace in Lucca.” “Ah, he has a palace?” said Danglars, laughing; “come, that is something.” “Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance while he lives in a simple house.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 66.

Chapter 66.

Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects,"But do you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so many questions?” “Ma foi,” said Danglars, “it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy, and you know I am a speculator.” “You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?” “Albert,” repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; “ah, well; he would care very little about it, I think.” “But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?” “Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame de Morcerf and Albert——” “You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?” “Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de Morcerf.” “Mademoiselle Danglars’ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.” “Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me——” “What?” “Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?” “I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.” “Yes, yes,” said Danglars, laughing, “it would do her a great deal of good.” “Why so?” “Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.” Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects,"“But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,” said the count, “you must allow that he has a fine name?” “So he has; but I like mine as well.” “Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years.” “And for this very reason,” said Danglars with a smile, which he tried to make sardonic, “I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de Morcerf.” “Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?” “The Morcerfs!—Stay, my dear count,” said Danglars; “you are a man of the world, are you not?” “I think so.” “And you understand heraldry?” “A little.” “Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf’s.” “Why so?” “Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least, Danglars.” “Well, what then?” “While his name is not Morcerf.” “How?—not Morcerf?” “Not the least in the world.” “Go on.” “I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a count, so that he is not one at all.” “Impossible!” “Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my acquaintance, during the last thirty years.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table, illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the abbé in a monk’s dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the Middle Ages.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 69. The Inquiry,“Have I the honor of addressing the Abbé Busoni?” asked the visitor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"“Yes, sir,” replied the abbé; “and you are the person whom M. de Boville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect of police?” “Exactly, sir.” “One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?” “Yes, sir” replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"I am a priest, sir, and the secrets of confession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not between me and human justice.” “Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your conscience.” At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger’s face, while his own remained obscured.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"“Excuse me, abbé,” said the envoy of the prefect of the police, “but the light tries my eyes very much.” The abbé lowered the shade.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"Do you know the Count of Monte Cristo?” “You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?” “Zaccone?—is not his name Monte Cristo?” “Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not a family name.” “Well, be it so—let us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte Cristo and M. Zaccone are the same——” “Absolutely the same.” “Let us speak of M. Zaccone.” “Agreed.” “I asked you if you knew him?” “Extremely well.” “Who is he?” “The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.” “I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not content itself with vague reports.” “However,” replied the abbé, with an affable smile, “when that report is in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police as well as all the rest.” “Are you sure of what you assert?” “What do you mean by that question?” “Understand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask if you are certain of it?” “I knew his father, M. Zaccone.” “Ah, indeed?” “And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.” “But whence does he derive the title of count?” “You are aware that may be bought.” “In Italy?” “Everywhere.” “And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?” “They may not be so very great.” “How much do you suppose he possesses?” “From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum.” “That is reasonable,” said the visitor; “I have heard he had three or four millions.” “Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.” “But I was told he had four millions per annum.” “That is not probable.” “Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo?” “Certainly, everyone who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to France by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must have seen it.” “I am told it is a delightful place?” “It is a rock.” “And why has the count bought a rock?” “For the sake of being a count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count.” “You have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zaccone’s youth?” “The father’s?” “No, the son’s.” “I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my young comrade.” “Was he in the wars?” “I think he entered the service.” “In what branch?” “In the navy.” “Are you not his confessor?” “No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.” “A Lutheran?” “I say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides, liberty of conscience is established in France.” “Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his actions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know of him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Cavalcanti to him.” “Andrea?” “No, Bartolomeo, his father.” “Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in the name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly.” “What is it, sir?” “Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at Auteuil?” “Certainly, for he told me.” “What is it, sir?” “To make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the Count of Pisani at Palermo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 69.

Chapter 69. The Inquiry,"“Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,” said Lord Wilmore; “he is a miser.” Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing no other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 70. The Ball,"I am not like you, viscount; you like your title, do you not?” “Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the millionaire.” “Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 70. The Ball,"“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does not last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician; for example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have just become bankrupts.” “Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Méran,"Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and informed her of her grandfather’s wish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Franz d’Épinay?” “Yes, madame.” “Is he not the son of General d’Épinay who was on our side, and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of Elba?” “The same.” “Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a Jacobin?” “Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,” said Villefort; “M.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Méran,"d’Épinay was quite a child when his father died, he knows very little of M.

Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Méran,"“Well, sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, after a few minutes’ reflection, “I must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time to live.” “You, madame?” “You, dear mamma?” exclaimed M. de Villefort and Valentine at the same time.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Méran,"I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor Renée, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.” “Ah, madame,” said Villefort, “you forget that I was obliged to give a mother to my child.” “A stepmother is never a mother, sir.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"This is what I shall do; I will wait until the very moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M.

Chapter 73.

Chapter 73. The Promise,"Now listen to me, Maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident—in short, if by any means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?” “Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.” “I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world, namely, by my mother.” “We will wait, then,” said Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“Yes, we will wait,” replied Valentine, who revived at these words; “there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are.” “I rely on you, Valentine,” said Morrel; “all you do will be well done; only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and Madame de Saint- Méran insist that M. d’Épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract——” “Then you have my promise, Maximilian.” “Instead of signing——” “I will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then, let us not tempt Providence, let us not see each other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"It was only on the following day, at about ten o’clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.

Chapter 73. The Promise,"Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say, “Here I am, Maximilian; come and help me.” He had arranged everything for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field; a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant, without lights; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps, as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when, from the top of that wall, he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine, pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near, he wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question from a friend would have irritated him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"He then said, “It is time to start; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o’clock, but perhaps Valentine will not wait for that.” Consequently, Morrel, having left the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered the clover-field while the clock of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule was striking eight.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin, where Morrel had often waited.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"The night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"The clock struck half-past eight, and still another half-hour was passed in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and gazed more and more frequently through the opening.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"The house, which was discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage- contract was going on.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Morrel looked at his watch, which wanted a quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,It was a terrible moment for the young man.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"The slightest rustling of the foliage, the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and drew the perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder, and, not to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“It is impossible,” said Maximilian, “that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"I have weighed all the chances, calculated the time required for all the forms; something must have happened.” And then he walked rapidly to and fro, and pressed his burning forehead against the fence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,Had Valentine fainted?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,At last the half-hour struck.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"It was impossible to wait longer, his temples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,He was on Villefort’s premises—had arrived there by scaling the wall.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,What might be the consequences?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"He followed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed a path, hid entered a clump of trees.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"In a moment he had passed through them, and could see the house distinctly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,30341m Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on days of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,These three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran’s room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,Morrel guessed all this.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine’s absence had done.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture everything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the misfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden, when the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne upon the wind, reached him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"At this sound, as he was already partially exposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely, remaining perfectly motionless.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,He had formed his resolution.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"If it was Valentine alone, he would speak as she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he should see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he would listen to their conversation, and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps, followed by a gentleman in black.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"They descended, and advanced towards the clump of trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor d’Avrigny.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"“I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you, there is another, perhaps, still greater.” “Can it be possible?” murmured Villefort, clasping his hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“What are you going to tell me?” “Are we quite alone, my friend?” “Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?” “Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,” said the doctor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"The doctor stood before him, with one hand placed on his shoulder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Morrel, horrified, supported his head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its beatings should be heard.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"“Speak, doctor—I am listening,” said Villefort; “strike—I am prepared for everything!” “Madame de Saint-Méran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she enjoyed excellent health.” Morrel began again to breathe freely, which he had not done during the last ten minutes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“Grief has consumed her,” said Villefort—“yes, grief, doctor!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"After living forty years with the marquis——” “It is not grief, my dear Villefort,” said the doctor; “grief may kill, although it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never in ten minutes.” Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his head, which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with amazement.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,“Were you present during the last struggle?” asked M. d’Avrigny.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“I was,” replied the procureur; “you begged me not to leave.” “Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de Saint- Méran has fallen a victim?” “I did.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks, at intervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"When you arrived, Madame de Saint-Méran had already been panting for breath some minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous attack, and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and her limbs and neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"This crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could not.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,You held her hand—you were feeling her pulse—and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"This was more terrible than the first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth contracted and turned purple.” “And at the third she expired.” “At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you confirmed my opinion.” “Yes, before others,” replied the doctor; “but now we are alone——” “What are you going to say?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Oh, spare me!” “That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same.” M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down again, silent and motionless.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“Listen,” said the doctor; “I know the full importance of the statement I have just made, and the disposition of the man to whom I have made it.” “Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?” asked Villefort.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I should hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a magistrate, but to a friend.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"And to that friend I say, ‘During the three-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the convulsions and the death of Madame de Saint-Méran, and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but I could also specify the poison.’” “Can it be possible?” “The symptoms are marked, do you see?—sleep broken by nervous spasms, excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Madame de Saint- Méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine, which by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.” Villefort seized the doctor’s hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“Oh, it is impossible,” said he, “I must be dreaming!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of madness.” “Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran?” “No.” “Has anything been sent for from a chemist’s that I have not examined?” “Nothing.” “Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies?” “Not to my knowledge.” “Would her death affect anyone’s interest?” “It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress—Valentine alone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Oh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.” “Indeed, my dear friend,” said M. d’Avrigny, “I would not accuse anyone; I speak only of an accident, you understand,—of a mistake,—but whether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Make inquiry.” “Of whom?—how?—of what?” “May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given Madame de Saint-Méran a dose prepared for his master?” “For my father?” “Yes.” “But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de Saint- Méran?” “Nothing is more simple.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases, of which paralysis is one.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"For instance, having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved to try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him brucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six grains.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"This double error became an irresistible reality, and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the flower- garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door, which opened without offering any resistance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,Valentine had not seen him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"She had turned from the window, which remained open, and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid, incoherent, unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"Alas, I would say you are welcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.” “Valentine,” said Morrel with a trembling voice, “I had waited since half-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy, leaped the wall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing about the fatal event——” “What voices?” asked Valentine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the purple lips.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“Your servants,” said he, “who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story; from them I learned it all.” “But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.” “Forgive me,” replied Morrel; “I will go away.” “No,” said Valentine, “you might meet someone; stay.” “But if anyone should come here——” The young girl shook her head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"“But what redoubles my sorrow,” continued the young girl, as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment, “is that the poor old lady, on her death-bed, requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible; she also, thinking to protect me, was acting against me.” “Hark!” said Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,They both listened; steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“It is my father, who has just left his study.” “To accompany the doctor to the door,” added Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"“I imagined it must be,” said Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close, then M. de Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"He stopped a moment in the anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de Saint-Méran’s; Morrel concealed himself behind a door; Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to deprive her of all fear.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,M. de Villefort passed on to his own room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"Are you sure you are more reasonable?” “Yes,” said Valentine; “and I have but one scruple,—that of leaving my dear grandmother’s remains, which I had undertaken to watch.” “Valentine,” said Morrel, “death is in itself sacred.” “Yes,” said Valentine; “besides, it will not be for long.” She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase to M.

Chapter 73. The Promise,"“It is M. Maximilian Morrel,” said she; “the son of that good merchant of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.” “Yes,” said the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“He brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of the Legion of Honor.” The old man signified that he recollected him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73.

Chapter 73. The Promise,"He told him his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when he consulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, “That is good, proceed.” “And now,” said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his recital, “now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you of my intentions?” “Yes,” signified the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"“This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister’s house, to marry her, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort’s pardon.” “No,” said Noirtier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 73. The Promise,"The old man’s interrogative eye said, “Which?” “I will go,” continued Maximilian, “I will seek M.

Chapter 73. The Promise,"“You wish to know what I will do?” “Yes.” “I will find him, as I told you.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"I will tell him the ties which bind me to Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure my friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through interest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no other, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall kill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry Valentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.” Noirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere countenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted, adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 73. The Promise,"Still, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which was his manner of saying “No.” “No?” said Morrel; “you disapprove of this second project, as you did of the first?” “I do,” signified the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Haydée,"Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation, added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.” “I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,” said Haydée quietly; “and if you like what is Eastern, I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.” “On what subject shall I converse with her?” said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples, or Florence.” “Oh,” said Albert, “it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let me speak to her of the East.” “Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste.” Albert turned towards Haydée.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“At what age did you leave Greece, signora?” asked he.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“I left it when I was but five years old,” replied Haydée.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“And have you any recollection of your country?” “When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,The mind can see as well as the body.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"The body forgets sometimes; but the mind always remembers.” “And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?” “I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which means royal,” said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, “took me by the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed, we went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the prisoners, saying, ‘He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.’ Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and without saying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was divided amongst the prisoners.” “And how old were you at that time?” “I was three years old,” said Haydée.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,“Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old?” said Albert.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“Everything.” “Count,” said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, “do allow the signora to tell me something of her history.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"You prohibited my mentioning my father’s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips.” Monte Cristo turned to Haydée, and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he said in Greek,—“Tell us the fate of your father; but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason.” Haydée sighed deeply, and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,“What are you saying to her?” said Morcerf in an undertone.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not conceal anything from you.” “Then,” said Albert, “this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance; what is the next?” “Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"Under the oldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either ‘Kill,’ or ‘Pardon.’” “It is very strange,” said Albert, “to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly to be saying to one’s self, ‘This is no fiction, it is all reality,’ in order to believe it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"And how does France appear in your eyes, accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?” “I think it is a fine country,” said Haydée, “but I see France as it really is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous.” “So young,” said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count’s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, “is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name?” Haydée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same time some imperceptible sign, murmured: “Go on.” “Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness.” 40068m “Speak, speak, signora,” said Albert, “I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say.” Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,"At other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child’s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother’s voice when she enjoined me to silence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,She bore me rapidly away.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,"Here and there on the walls of the staircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the flickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,“‘Quick!’ said a voice at the end of the gallery.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,"My father,” said Haydée, raising her head, “was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey trembled.” Albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Haydée at this moment; she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"“Soon,” said Haydée, “we halted on our march, and found ourselves on the borders of a lake.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,We stepped into the boat.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water, and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palikares.14 Besides the rowers, the boat contained only the women, my father, mother, Selim, and myself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps, and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others, in case of pursuit.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,"“No,” said she, “I do not remember it just at this moment; but if it should occur to me presently, I will tell you.” Albert was on the point of pronouncing his father’s name, when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young man recollected his promise, and was silent.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,"Monte Cristo arose and approached her, took her hand, and said to her in Romaic: “Calm yourself, my dear child, and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors.” “It is a frightful story, count,” said Albert, terrified at the paleness of Haydée’s countenance, “and I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request.” “Oh, it is nothing,” said Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 77. Haydée,"Then, patting the young girl on the head, he continued, “Haydée is very courageous, and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes.” “Because, my lord,” said Haydée eagerly, “my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness.” Albert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what he most desired to know,—how she had become the slave of the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 77. Haydée,"They were surrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when suddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates, and beneath which were inscribed these words: ‘This is the head of Ali Tepelini, Pasha of Yanina.’ “I cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she was dead!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"M. d’Épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not have anticipated him in this announcement.” No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"And in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier, who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always omitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life entertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d’Épinay, as he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been conferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was killed fairly in a duel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"M. de Villefort’s communications on the subject were very limited and concise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place between M. Noirtier, M. d’Épinay, and himself, and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 78.

Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"Oh, Morrel, pray love him for all his goodness to us!” Morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father, he worshiped him as a god.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“But tell me, Valentine, how has it all been effected?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"What strange means has he used to compass this blessed end?” Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said: “At some future time I will tell you all about it.” “But when will that be?” “When I am your wife.” The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel, that he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"However, he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“Sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine’s marriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was concluded.” Noirtier’s countenance remained immovable.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware; that is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.” Noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an explanation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked, is done away with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake.” Noirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“I come to entreat you, sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, “as the only one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—I come to entreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always possessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.” There was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not succeed in doing so.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “that your intentions accord with my request?” Noirtier made a sign that they did.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 78.

Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"40086m “Well, baron,” said he, “here I am at last; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.” Morcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it grew darker and darker.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“To what do you allude, monsieur?” said Danglars; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general’s words.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"Ma foi, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.” And Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars, said: “Baron, I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.” But Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said: “Monsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.” “To reflect?” said Morcerf, more and more astonished; “have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?” “Count,” said the banker, “things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them.” “I do not understand you, baron,” said Morcerf.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“What I mean to say is this, sir,—that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred——” “Excuse me,” said Morcerf, “but is it a play we are acting?” “A play?” “Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other.” “That is quite my desire.” “You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not?” “I see him very often,” said Danglars, drawing himself up; “he is a particular friend of mine.” “Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did you not?” “I did say so.” “Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.” Danglars did not answer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina,"“Have you so soon changed your mind,” added Morcerf, “or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled?” Danglars, seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and said: “Count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but, believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me.” “These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,” said Morcerf: “they might satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to him his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.” Danglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 82. The Burglary,The little light in the lodge had long been extinct.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"It might be expected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be made from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in Monte Cristo’s opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"It would be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the back staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"40152m As the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding, was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew what to expect.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,The count felt his heart beat more rapidly.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as they may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream and a reality, between the project and the execution.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"However, Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali, who, understanding that danger was approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his master.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing-room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"He fixed his eyes on that window—he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside, then the square cracked without falling.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its hinges, and a man entered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,He was alone.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“That’s a daring rascal,” whispered the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"He turned; Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“I see!” said he, “there are two of them; one does the work while the other stands guard.” He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms stretched out before him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,There were two doors; he bolted them both.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"When he drew near to the bedroom door, Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,It was only a precaution.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue his purpose with full security.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Alone and free to act as he wished, the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern, placed it on a stand, then went straight to the secretaire, felt the lock, and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,But the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock, and which thieves call nightingales, doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Ah, ha,” whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment, “he is only a thief.” But the man in the dark could not find the right key.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately a pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was reflected on his hands and countenance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“By heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, starting back, “it is——” Ali raised his hatchet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Don’t stir,” whispered Monte Cristo, “and put down your hatchet; we shall require no arms.” 40154m Then he added some words in a low tone, for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count, faint as it had been, had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife-grinder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"It was an order the count had just given, for immediately Ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat, waistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail, of which the last in France, where daggers are no longer dreaded, was worn by King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his breast, and whose head was cleft with a hatchet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock, as did his hair under a priest’s wig; the three-cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Try again,” whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring, which was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be—“try again, you have a few minutes’ work there.” And he advanced to the window.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it appeared, he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the Champs-Élysées or by the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count’s, and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered: “Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear, whatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.” Ali bowed in token of strict obedience.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock, silently opened the door, taking care that the light should shine directly on his face.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illuminated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,He turned.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,” said Monte Cristo; “what are you doing here, at such an hour?” 40156m “The Abbé Busoni!” exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he let fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“The Abbé Busoni!” repeated Caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbé Busoni himself,” replied Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“And I am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it proves you have a good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.” This calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“The abbé, the abbé!” murmured he, clenching his fists, and his teeth chattering.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,“So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?” continued the false abbé.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Reverend sir,” murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window, which the count pitilessly blocked—“reverend sir, I don’t know—believe me—I take my oath——” “A pane of glass out,” continued the count, “a dark lantern, a bunch of false keys, a secretaire half forced—it is tolerably evident——” Caderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in, some way of escape.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Come, come,” continued the count, “I see you are still the same,—an assassin.” “Reverend sir, since you know everything, you know it was not I—it was La Carconte; that was proved at the trial, since I was only condemned to the galleys.” “Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to return there?” “No, reverend sir; I have been liberated by someone.” “That someone has done society a great kindness.” “Ah,” said Caderousse, “I had promised——” “And you are breaking your promise!” interrupted Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Alas, yes!” said Caderousse very uneasily.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“A bad relapse, that will lead you, if I mistake not, to the Place de Grève.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"So much the worse, so much the worse—diavolo!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"as they say in my country.” “Reverend sir, I am impelled——” “Every criminal says the same thing.” “Poverty——” “Pshaw!” said Busoni disdainfully; “poverty may make a man beg, steal a loaf of bread at a baker’s door, but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"And when the jeweller Johannes had just paid you 45,000 francs for the diamond I had given you, and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both, was that also poverty?” “Pardon, reverend sir,” said Caderousse; “you have saved my life once, save me again!” “That is but poor encouragement.” “Are you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize me?” “I am alone,” said the abbé, “and I will again have pity on you, and will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to, if you tell me the truth.” “Ah, reverend sir,” cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing nearer to Monte Cristo, “I may indeed say you are my deliverer!” “You mean to say you have been freed from confinement?” “Yes, that is true, reverend sir.” “Who was your liberator?” “An Englishman.” “What was his name?” “Lord Wilmore.” “I know him; I shall know if you lie.” “Ah, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth.” “Was this Englishman protecting you?” “No, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion.” “What was this young Corsican’s name?” “Benedetto.” “Is that his Christian name?” “He had no other; he was a foundling.” “Then this young man escaped with you?” “He did.” “In what way?” “We were working at Saint-Mandrier, near Toulon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Do you know Saint- Mandrier?” “I do.” “In the hour of rest, between noon and one o’clock——” “Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,We may well pity the poor fellows!” said the abbé.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Nay,” said Caderousse, “one can’t always work—one is not a dog.” “So much the better for the dogs,” said Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“While the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us, and swam away.” “And what is become of this Benedetto?” “I don’t know.” “You ought to know.” “No, in truth; we parted at Hyères.” And, to give more weight to his protestation, Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé, who remained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing his interrogation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“You lie,” said the Abbé Busoni, with a tone of irresistible authority.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,“Reverend sir!” “You lie!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"This man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of him as your accomplice.” 40160m “Oh, reverend sir!” “Since you left Toulon what have you lived on?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Answer me!” “On what I could get.” “You lie,” repeated the abbé a third time, with a still more imperative tone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Caderousse, terrified, looked at the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“You have lived on the money he has given you.” “True,” said Caderousse; “Benedetto has become the son of a great lord.” “How can he be the son of a great lord?” “A natural son.” “And what is that great lord’s name?” “The Count of Monte Cristo, the very same in whose house we are.” “Benedetto the count’s son?” replied Monte Cristo, astonished in his turn.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Well, I should think so, since the count has found him a false father—since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and leaves him 500,000 francs in his will.” “Ah, yes,” said the factitious abbé, who began to understand; “and what name does the young man bear meanwhile?” “Andrea Cavalcanti.” “Is it, then, that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo has received into his house, and who is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?” “Exactly.” “And you suffer that, you wretch!—you, who know his life and his crime?” “Why should I stand in a comrade’s way?” said Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“You are right; it is not you who should apprise M. Danglars, it is I.” “Do not do so, reverend sir.” “Why not?” “Because you would bring us to ruin.” “And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?” “Reverend sir,” said Caderousse, drawing still nearer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“I will expose all.” “To whom?” “To M. Danglars.” “By Heaven!” cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open knife, and striking the count in the breast, “you shall disclose nothing, reverend sir!” To Caderousse’s great astonishment, the knife, instead of piercing the count’s breast, flew back blunted.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin’s wrist, and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"But the count, disregarding his cry, continued to wring the bandit’s wrist, until, his arm being dislocated, he fell first on his knees, then flat on the floor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The count then placed his foot on his head, saying, “I know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull, rascal.” “Ah, mercy—mercy!” cried Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,The count withdrew his foot.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,40162m “Rise!” said he.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,Caderousse rose.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“What a wrist you have, reverend sir!” said Caderousse, stroking his arm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it; “what a wrist!” “Silence!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you; in the name of that God I act,—remember that, wretch,—and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him.” “Oh!” said Caderousse, groaning with pain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate.” “I don’t know how to write, reverend sir.” “You lie!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Take this pen, and write!” Caderousse, awed by the superior power of the abbé, sat down and wrote: “Sir,—The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you intend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at Toulon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“The address, ‘To monsieur the Baron Danglars, banker, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.’” Caderousse wrote the address.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,The abbé took the note.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Now,” said he, “that suffices—begone!” “Which way?” “The way you came.” “You wish me to get out at that window?” “You got in very well.” “Oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.” “Idiot!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"what design can I have?” “Why, then, not let me out by the door?” “What would be the advantage of waking the porter?” “Ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?” “I wish what God wills.” “But swear that you will not strike me as I go down.” “Cowardly fool!” “What do you intend doing with me?” “I ask you what can I do?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"I have tried to make you a happy man, and you have turned out a murderer.” “Oh, monsieur,” said Caderousse, “make one more attempt—try me once more!” “I will,” said the count.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Listen—you know if I may be relied on.” “Yes,” said Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82.

Chapter 82. The Burglary,"40164m “Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you too.” “As true as I am a Christian,” stammered Caderousse, “you will make me die of fright!” “Now begone,” said the count, pointing to the window.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Caderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"“Now go down,” said the abbé, folding his arms.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him, Caderousse began to go down.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Then the count brought the taper to the window, that it might be seen in the Champs-Élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 82. The Burglary,"He then descended, but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the garden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"The count then looking over into the street, saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,No one could be seen or heard.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,The clock of the Invalides struck one.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Then Caderousse sat astride the coping, and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend, or rather to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"But, once started, he could not stop.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder, crying, “Help!” A second blow struck him almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, “Help, murder!” Then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by the hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 82. The Burglary,"This time Caderousse endeavored to call again, but he could only utter a groan, and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 89.

Chapter 89. The Night,"“That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercédès and my deceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and—I have revenged myself.” “And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?” “I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides, that is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass over to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against the Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and murdered Ali.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 93. Valentine,"As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the dictionary.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how to understand the old man quickly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"Accustomed, however, as he was to the work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words, “Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine’s room.” Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois’s situation, and in Noirtier’s name gave that order.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 93. Valentine,Noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,“Why are the glass and decanter empty?” asked he; “Valentine said she only drank half the glassful.” The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"“I do not know,” said the servant, “but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentine’s room: perhaps she has emptied them.” “Ask her,” said Morrel, translating Noirtier’s thought this time by his look.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"The servant went out, but returned almost immediately.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"“Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villefort’s,” said he; “and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank what remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks.” Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"From that moment the old man’s eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 93. Valentine,"Besides, he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic—that is his word.” “And then,” said Eugénie, while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villefort’s album, “add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man.” “And,” said Madame de Villefort, “I need not ask you if you share that fancy.” “I?” replied Eugénie with her usual candor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 93. Valentine,The general depended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 93. Valentine,"“Retire, Valentine,” said she; “you are really suffering, and these ladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you.” Valentine kissed Eugénie, bowed to Madame Danglars, who had already risen to take her leave, and went out.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93. Valentine,"“That poor child,” said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone, “she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness.” Meanwhile, Valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand, had crossed Edward’s room without noticing some trick of the child, and through her own had reached the little staircase.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 93.

Chapter 94. Maximilian’s Avowal,"He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection—the conversation he had heard between the doctor and Villefort the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death, recurred to him; these symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 94. Maximilian’s Avowal,"At the same time Monte Cristo’s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before, “Whatever you want, Morrel, come to me; I have great power.” More rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 94. Maximilian’s Avowal,"What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God?” A mournful sob burst from Villefort’s heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his arm,—“Valentine,” said he, “it is Valentine’s turn!” 40284m “Your daughter!” cried d’Avrigny with grief and surprise.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 94. Maximilian’s Avowal,"“You see you were deceived,” murmured the magistrate; “come and see her, and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her.” “Each time you have applied to me,” said the doctor, “it has been too late; still I will go.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 94.

Chapter 95. Father and Daughter,"However, this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience.” “Well?” asked Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 95. Father and Daughter,"“Well, sir,” replied Eugénie, “I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible.” “But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation and force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, Eugénie?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"These were the reasons which, added to the fatigue, caused Andrea to sleep so soundly.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose temper he well knew, and which was never absent from him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight, which played, warm and brilliant, upon his face.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"In all well-organized brains, the predominating idea—and there always is one—is sure to be the last thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the morning.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,He jumped out of bed and ran to the window.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,A gendarme was crossing the court.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world, even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a timid conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white uniform is really very alarming.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,“Why is that gendarme there?” asked Andrea of himself.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Then, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has, doubtless, remarked in him, “There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.” And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Now then,” said Andrea, while dressing himself, “I’ll wait till he leaves, and then I’ll slip away.” 50047m And, saying this, Andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat, stole gently to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,“They’re after me!” was Andrea’s first thought.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Diable!” A pallor overspread the young man’s forehead, and he looked around him with anxiety.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"His room, like all those on the same floor, had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“I am lost!” was his second thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea’s situation, an arrest meant the assizes, trial, and death,—death without mercy or delay.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands, and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper: “I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"I shall be excused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.” He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"This done, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting to close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise, after replacing the chimney-board, which represented Achilles with Deidamia, and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes, he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel, which afforded him the only means of escape left.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"At daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Compiègne, that royal residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities, gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed their first inquiries there.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville, which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The sentinel who was relieved at six o’clock in the morning, remembered perfectly that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The young man, having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel, which was opened, and again closed after his entrance.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"This late arrival had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other than Andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed their steps towards his room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,They found the door ajar.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Oh, oh,” said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; “a bad sign to find the door open!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"I would rather find it triply bolted.” And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or rather corroborated, the sad truth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,Andrea had fled.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"We say corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the chimney with them, set a light to it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The fire crackled, and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell down, as they expected.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the fire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney-pots.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"50049m At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, “He is not here!” But venturing to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching with increased attention.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"It was now his turn to look about him; the Hôtel de Ville, a massive sixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below, and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"If once discovered, he knew he would be lost, for the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to descend, not through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a similar one conducting to another room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having reached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"At the same minute, one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,“Well?” asked the two gendarmes.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Well, my boys,” said the brigadier, “the brigand must really have escaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets and Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no doubt.” The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a loud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded through the court of the hotel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Ah, what is that?” cried the brigadier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Some traveller seems impatient,” said the host.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“What number was it that rang?” “Number 3.” “Run, waiter!” At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Aha!” said the brigadier, stopping the servant, “the person who is ringing appears to want something more than amwaiter; we will attend upon him with a gendarme.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Who occupies Number 3?” “The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.” The bell here rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Follow me, Mr. Commissary!” said the brigadier; “tread in my steps.” “Wait an instant,” said the host; “Number 3 has two staircases,—inside and outside.” “Good,” said the brigadier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,“I will take charge of the inside one.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Are the carbines loaded?” “Yes, brigadier.” “Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon him; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.” The brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the crowd.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"This is what had happened: Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"It would have signified little had the room been empty, but unfortunately it was occupied.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Two ladies, sleeping in one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"One of these ladies, the fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope, rang with all her strength.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“For pity’s sake,” he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom he was addressing,—“for pity’s sake do not call assistance!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Save me!—I will not harm you.” “Andrea, the murderer!” cried one of the ladies.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,“Eugénie!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Mademoiselle Danglars!” exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Help, help!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, taking the bell from her companion’s hand, and ringing it yet more violently.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Save me, I am pursued!” said Andrea, clasping his hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“For pity, for mercy’s sake do not deliver me up!” “It is too late, they are coming,” said Eugénie.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed; you can turn their suspicions and save my life!” 50053m The two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating voice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Well, be it so,” at length said Eugénie; “return by the same road you came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.” “Here he is, here he is!” cried a voice from the landing; “here he is!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"I see him!” The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had discovered Andrea in a posture of entreaty.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"A violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts, and the broken door fell in.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Andrea ran to the other door, leading to the gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood with his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in his clenched hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Fly, then!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, whose pity returned as her fears diminished; “fly!” “Or kill yourself!” said Eugénie (in a tone which a Vestal in the amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary).",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Andrea shuddered, and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Kill myself?” he cried, throwing down his knife; “why should I do so?” “Why, you said,” answered Mademoiselle Danglars, “that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals.” 50055m “Bah,” said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, “one has friends.” The brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Come, come,” said Andrea, “sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there is no occasion to make such a fuss, since I give myself up;” and he held out his hands to be manacled.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley- slave.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile asked, “Have you any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars, for in all probability I shall return to Paris?” Eugénie covered her face with her hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Oh, oh!” said Andrea, “you need not be ashamed, even though you did post after me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Was I not nearly your husband?” 50056m And with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"An hour after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but they were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"Eugénie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear, and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"“Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?” she exclaimed, throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d’Armilly, her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,"The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre, at Brussels.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern,The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d’Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"The baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugénie’s character, could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Now, Madame Danglars feared Eugénie’s sagacity and the influence of Mademoiselle d’Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,—an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother’s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw that Eugénie detested Debray, not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through a certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the marriage of Eugénie had not taken place, not only because the match was good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it would also set her at liberty.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"She ran therefore to Debray, who, after having, like the rest of Paris, witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the world.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"At the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and concealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray’s apartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home, Debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the family, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Debray did not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of Eugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in his heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till one o’clock in the morning.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Meanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of Debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers, which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"At twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting, returned home.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect, they seldom return home after twelve o’clock.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in leaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered her apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugénie.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"She was fearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter’s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"She listened at Eugénie’s door, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to sleep.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,She called the maid and questioned her.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"“Mademoiselle Eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle d’Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.” Since then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore, went to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"In proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing, was in reality a disgrace.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès, who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"“Eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"The affair, as it will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"How fortunate that Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble!” And her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious Providence disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes produces a blessing.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"And then her thoughts, cleaving through space like a bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"This Andrea was a wretch, a robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable name.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation?,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Debray, to whom she had run, with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves, and who yet betrays her,—Debray could but give her advice, she must apply to someone more powerful than he.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"It was M. de Villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though they had been strangers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not a merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties, but the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the surgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son-in-law.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars, had acted in this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea’s intrigues.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Villefort’s conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she would, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"She would invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"M. de Villefort would stifle the affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea to fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,And after this reasoning she slept easily.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"At nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night; then running downstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a cab, and drove to M. de Villefort’s house.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,For the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Some of the apartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only opened to admit a minute’s air, showing the scared face of a footman, and immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice, “Will there be another funeral today at the procureur’s house?” Madame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion; descending from the cab, she approached the door with trembling knees, and rang the bell.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Three times did the bell ring with a dull, heavy sound, seeming to participate, in the general sadness, before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door, which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"He saw a lady, a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady, and yet the door remained almost closed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,“Do you intend opening the door?” said the baroness.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"“First, madame, who are you?” “Who am I?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"You know me well enough.” “We no longer know anyone, madame.” “You must be mad, my friend,” said the baroness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"“Where do you come from?” “Oh, this is too much!” “Madame, these are my orders; excuse me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Your name?” “The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times.” “Possibly, madame.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"And now, what do you want?” “Oh, how extraordinary!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the impertinence of his servants.” “Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here without an order from M. d’Avrigny, or without speaking to the procureur.” “Well, I have business with the procureur.” “Is it pressing business?” “You can imagine so, since I have not even brought my carriage out yet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"But enough of this—here is my card, take it to your master.” “Madame will await my return?” “Yes; go.” The concierge closed the door, leaving Madame Danglars in the street.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again shut.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,"Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and blew it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99. The Law,The valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 99.

Chapter 99. The Law,"The baroness ascended the steps; she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never lost sight of her for an instant, she was introduced to the magistrate’s study.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 99. The Law,"“Forgive my servants,” he said, “for a terror I cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become suspicious.” Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 99. The Law,"You were saying, madame——” “I came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done with this impostor?” “Impostor,” repeated Villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 99. The Law,"“You were saying this, were you not?” “Well, I own it.” “I will answer you.” Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual: “There are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown, and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but when the culprits are discovered” (Villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)—“when they are discovered, I swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever they may be they shall die.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 100. The Apparition,But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and confused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented themselves before her eyes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"During the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear, owing to the constant presence of M.

Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Now four days had elapsed, and Valentine still lived.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with their trembling wings.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"First she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes mere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and this state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep, heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till daylight.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100.

Chapter 100.

Chapter 100. The Apparition,"The night-lamp threw out countless rays, each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination, when suddenly by its flickering light Valentine thought she saw the door of her library, which was in the recess by the chimney-piece, open slowly, though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present situation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100.

Chapter 100. The Apparition,At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"“It is not he,” she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this was but a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Still, she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink, for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time she suffered less.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass, but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her, and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of his hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"This time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything Valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really alive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Then the figure, from whom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting than menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held it up, as if to test its transparency.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"This did not seem sufficient; the man, or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was heard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again approached her, and said in an agitated voice, “Now you may drink.” Valentine shuddered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"It was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an exclamation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 100. The Apparition,“The Count of Monte Cristo!” she murmured.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl’s mind as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Still, the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"“Do not call anyone—do not be alarmed,” said the count; “do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast; the man standing before you, Valentine (for this time it is no ghost), is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of.” Valentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, “If your intentions are pure, why are you here?” The count’s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl’s mind.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"“Listen to me,” he said, “or, rather, look upon me; look at my face, paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days I have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to protect and preserve you for Maximilian.” The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Are you a doctor?” “Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.” “But you say you have watched?” said Valentine uneasily; “where have you been?—I have not seen you.” The count extended his hand towards the library.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"“I was hidden behind that door,” he said, “which leads into the next house, which I have rented.” Valentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear, exclaimed: “Sir, I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and that what you call protection is more like an insult.” “Valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all I have observed has been what people visited you, what nourishment was prepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared dangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the place of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing the death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.” “Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?” 50071m “Hush, my child,” said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her lips, “I did say poison and death.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"But drink some of this;” and the count took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which he poured a few drops into the glass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 100.

Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Would not M. Noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison?” “Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month?” “And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of dried orange-peel?” “Oh, yes, yes!” “Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"“Your grandfather knows, then, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Have you never seen anyone enter your room at night?” “Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach, and disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the influence of delirium.” “Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?” 50073m “No,” said Valentine; “who could desire my death?” “You shall know it now, then,” said Monte Cristo, listening.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 100. The Apparition,"“How do you mean?” said Valentine, looking anxiously around.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 100. The Apparition,"Before closing the door he turned around once more, and said, “Not a movement—not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be killed before I have the power of helping you.” And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door, which noiselessly closed after him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 101. Locusta,"Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited the event.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Valentine summoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,“Valentine!” said a low voice.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,Still silent: Valentine had promised not to wake.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Then everything was still, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Then she ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,She saw a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept: it was Madame de Villefort.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder, which caused a vibration in the bed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains, she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of Valentine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself to close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost impossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Madame de Villefort, however, reassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair round arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread death around her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,50077m It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to insensibility.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,She raised her head with an effort.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"The noiseless door again turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?” “Oh,” murmured the young girl.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,“Have you seen?” “Alas!” “Did you recognize?” Valentine groaned.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!” “Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian’s death?” “Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the house?—can I not escape?” “Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"You will find it in the water you drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.” “But did you not say that my kind grandfather’s precaution had neutralized the poison?” “Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and the quantity increased.” He took the glass and raised it to his lips.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“It is already done,” he said; “brucine is no longer employed, but a simple narcotic!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has poured into your glass, Valentine—Valentine—you would have been doomed!” “But,” exclaimed the young girl, “why am I thus pursued?” “Why?—are you so kind—so good—so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot understand, Valentine?” “No, I have never injured her.” “But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.” “How so?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my relations.” “Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died; that is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that is why you, in your turn, are to die—it is because your father would inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his.” “Edward?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,Poor child!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Are all these crimes committed on his account?” “Ah, then you at length understand?” “Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!” “Valentine, you are an angel!” “But why is my grandfather allowed to live?” “It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert to your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime appearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.” “And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman?” “Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hôtel des Postes, at Perugia, seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Well, ever since then, the infernal project has been ripening in her brain.” “Ah, then, indeed, sir,” said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, “I see that I am condemned to die!” “No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is conquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine—live to be happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to insure this you must rely on me.” “Command me, sir—what am I to do?” “You must blindly take what I give you.” “Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!” “You must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.” “My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?” asked Valentine, clasping her hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations, ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally; it is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my place—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against the assassin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Spectre against spectre!” he murmured in a low voice, as he concluded his sentence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“Sir,” said Valentine, “I will do all I can to live, for there are two beings who love me and will die if I die—my grandfather and Maximilian.” “I will watch over them as I have over you.” “Well, sir, do as you will with me;” and then she added, in a low voice, “oh, heavens, what will befall me?” “Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer; though you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though you should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear; even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Reassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: ‘At this moment, a friend, a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian, watches over me!’” “Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!” “Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?” “I would rather die a hundred times—oh, yes, die!” “No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that you will not complain, but hope?” “I will think of Maximilian!” “You are my own darling child, Valentine!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"I alone can save you, and I will.” Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,—for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,—and began to pray, and while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl’s arm, drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat, and said with a paternal smile: “My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of Providence and the love of Maximilian.” Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude, and remained as docile as a child.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Then he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised the golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea, which he placed in her hand.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"She took it, and looked attentively on the count; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,She evidently interrogated him by her look.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"“Yes,” said he.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 101. Locusta,"I will try and gain a little sleep, for you are saved.” “Go,” said Valentine, “whatever happens, I promise you not to fear.” Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 101. Locusta,"Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had taken it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after throwing a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening before it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"All noise in the streets had ceased, and the silence was frightful.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"It was then that the door of Edward’s room opened, and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was Madame de Villefort, who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"She stopped in the doorway, listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp, the only sound in that deserted room, and then advanced to the table to see if Valentine’s glass were empty.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"It was still about a quarter full, as we before stated.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes, which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid; then she carefully rinsed the glass, and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on Valentine.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The dim light, the profound silence, and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more by her own conscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"At length she rallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on Valentine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The young girl no longer breathed, no breath issued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no longer quivered—the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl’s heart.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,It was cold and motionless.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers, and withdrew her hand with a shudder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"One arm was hanging out of the bed; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of Germain Pillon’s “Graces,”23 but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The nails, too, were turning blue.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt; all was over—she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"There was no more to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,The minutes passed; Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of Valentine.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"She was lost in reverie, and the reverie of crime is remorse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Just then the lamp again flickered; the noise startled Madame de Villefort, who shuddered and dropped the curtain.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Immediately afterwards the light expired, and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity, while the clock at that minute struck half-past four.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Overpowered with agitation, the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door, and reached her room in an agony of fear.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The darkness lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in the room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,About this time the nurse’s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"To the tender eye of a father or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine’s condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to sleep.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Good,” she exclaimed, approaching the table, “she has taken part of her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.” Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she had just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentine’s sleep, so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,The clock striking eight awoke her.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and for the first time noticed the white lips.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"She tried to replace the arm, but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed: “Help, help!” 50083m “What is the matter?” asked M. d’Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it being the hour he usually visited her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“What is it?” asked Villefort, rushing from his room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Doctor, do you hear them call for help?” “Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine’s room.” But before the doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants who were on the same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed, as though struck by lightening.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Call Madame de Villefort!—Wake Madame de Villefort!” cried the procureur from the door of his chamber, which apparently he scarcely dared to leave.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"But instead of obeying him, the servants stood watching M. d’Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised her in his arms.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“What?—this one, too?” he exclaimed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Oh, where will be the end?” Villefort rushed into the room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“What are you saying, doctor?” he exclaimed, raising his hands to heaven.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“I say that Valentine is dead!” replied d’Avrigny, in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,50085m M. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"On the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all fled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages, then there was a rush in the court, afterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the accursed house.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Just then, Madame de Villefort, in the act of slipping on her dressing- gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless, as though interrogating the occupants of the room, while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"On a sudden she stepped, or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"She saw d’Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain of having emptied during the night.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"It was now a third full, just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,The spectre of Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"It was, indeed, the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass, and which Valentine had drunk; it was indeed the poison, which could not deceive M. d’Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it was doubtless a miracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her precautions, there should be some trace, some proof remaining to reveal the crime.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"While Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror, and Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw nothing around him, d’Avrigny approached the window, that he might the better examine the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his finger in, tasted it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Ah,” he exclaimed, “it is no longer brucine that is used; let me see what it is!” Then he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine’s room, which had been transformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor, which immediately changed to a blood-red color.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Ah,” exclaimed d’Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Madame de Villefort was overpowered; her eyes first flashed and then swam, she staggered towards the door and disappeared.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard, but no one paid any attention to it; the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis, and Villefort was still absorbed in grief.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"M. d’Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes, and watched her hurried retreat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"He lifted up the drapery over the entrance to Edward’s room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villefort’s apartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort,” he said to the nurse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,“Madame de Villefort is ill.” 50087m “But Mademoiselle de Villefort——” stammered the nurse.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help,” said d’Avrigny, “since she is dead.” “Dead,—dead!” groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,“Dead!” repeated a third voice.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Who said Valentine was dead?” The two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and terror-stricken.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 102. Valentine,"Every night the count had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and he called a second and third time; still no answer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,Then he determined to go up.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Noirtier’s room was opened, like all the rest.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place, but his eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 102. Valentine,"“Well,” answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"“You are thoughtful, sir,” continued Morrel; “you want something; shall I call one of the servants?” “Yes,” replied Noirtier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 102. Valentine,"Morrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse, gazed all around the room, then upon the two men; he opened his mouth to speak, but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d’Avrigny, for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances, which seemed to say,—“He is mad!” But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the hand of Valentine, and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs, exclamations, and prayers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"At length Villefort, the most composed of all, spoke: “Sir,” said he to Maximilian, “you say you loved Valentine, that you were betrothed to her.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"I knew nothing of this engagement, of this love, yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that your grief is real and deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest.” 50093m “You are mistaken, sir,” exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on one knee, his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt—“you are mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest, but an avenger.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"You, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; I will be the avenger.” “What do you mean, sir?” asked Villefort, trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Morrel.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.” The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d’Avrigny approached.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103.

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Now, sir,” continued Morrel, “in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful, and adorable creature like Valentine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"Now, M. le Procureur du Roi,” said Morrel with increasing vehemence, “no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is your place to seek the assassin.” The young man’s implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to d’Avrigny.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father, he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of Maximilian.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Yes,” indicated the old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Assuredly,” said d’Avrigny.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,I am stricken by fate.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"It is horrible, indeed, but no one assassinates.” The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d’Avrigny prepared to speak.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“And I say that murders are committed here,” said Morrel, whose voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: “I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"I tell you, Valentine’s life was attempted by poison four days ago, though she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"I tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has succeeded.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"I tell you that you know these things as well as I do, since this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a friend.” “Oh, you rave, sir,” exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"50095m “I rave?” said Morrel; “well, then, I appeal to M. d’Avrigny himself.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"You thought yourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of Valentine.” Villefort and d’Avrigny exchanged looks.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Yes, yes,” continued Morrel; “recall the scene, for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103.

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy father abandon thee, Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall pursue the assassin.” And this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of Morrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so long rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,Then d’Avrigny spoke.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“And I, too,” he exclaimed in a low voice, “I unite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.” “Oh, merciful Heavens!” murmured Villefort.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Yes,” replied Noirtier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,“And will you direct us?” exclaimed the young man.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Listen, M. d’Avrigny, listen!” Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy, and thus fixed his attention.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"D’Avrigny took the young man’s arm, and led him out of the room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,A more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d’Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“You can come,” he said, and led them back to Noirtier.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Gentlemen,” he said in a hoarse voice, “give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!” The two men drew back.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,“I entreat you——” continued Villefort.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Oh, sir,” said Villefort, arresting Maximilian by the arm, “if my father, the inflexible man, makes this request, it is because he knows, be assured, that Valentine will be terribly revenged.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Yes,” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,"“Swear, then,” said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and d’Avrigny, “swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave me to avenge my child.” D’Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “Yes,” but Morrel, disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left, uttering a long, deep groan of despair and anguish.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 103. Maximilian,We have before stated that all the servants had fled.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"At the end of a quarter of an hour M. d’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate closed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was obliged to open to them.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old man’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 103. Maximilian,"Come and watch by the dead, and all the wretched family will be grateful to you.” “I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine.” D’Avrigny took the priest’s hand, and without meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine’s room, which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

The Lions’ Den,"There, crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes talking to one another, but more frequently alone, watching the door, which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or to throw in another outcast from society.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"It is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered; it is so rare for them to leave the Lions’ Den for any other place than the barrier Saint-Jacques, the galleys!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,or solitary confinement.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"In the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp vapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the “Den,” might be seen walking.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they did not show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful hands of the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"He bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt, which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison, and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,Some of the inmates of the “Lions’ Den” were watching the operations of the prisoner’s toilet with considerable interest.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“See, the prince is pluming himself,” said one of the thieves.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“He’s a fine looking fellow,” said another; “if he had only a comb and hair-grease, he’d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids.” “His coat looks almost new, and his boots shine like a nigger’s face.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"It’s pleasant to have such well-dressed comrades; but didn’t those gendarmes behave shameful?—must ’a been jealous, to tear such clothes!” “He looks like a big-bug,” said another; “dresses in fine style.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"And, then, to be here so young!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Oh, what larks!” Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket, against which one of the keepers was leaning.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“Come, sir,” he said, “lend me twenty francs; you will soon be paid; you run no risks with me.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Come, I beseech you, lend me twenty francs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"And what a coat, sir, for a prince of the Cavalcanti!” The keeper turned his back, and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so many utter the same things,—indeed, he heard nothing else.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“Come,” said Andrea, “you are a man void of compassion; I’ll have you turned out.” This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud laugh.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,The prisoners then approached and formed a circle.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“I tell you that with that wretched sum,” continued Andrea, “I could obtain a coat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily expecting.” “Of course—of course,” said the prisoners;—“anyone can see he’s a gentleman!” “Well, then, lend him the twenty francs,” said the keeper, leaning on the other shoulder; “surely you will not refuse a comrade!” 50151m “I am no comrade of these people,” said the young man, proudly, “you have no right to insult me thus.” The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"The latter, sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea, and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"The thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, “La savate—La savate!”26 a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but with an iron- heeled one.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Others proposed the anguille, another kind of recreation, in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles, and two-sous pieces, when they have them, which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,“Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman!” said others.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"But Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,It was a Masonic sign Caderousse had taught him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"He was immediately recognized as one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be civil, in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience,—and the mob retired.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"The keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person, attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions’ Den to something more substantial than mere fascination.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Andrea made no resistance, although he protested against it.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,Suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,“You see someone pays me a visit.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!” And Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out through the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Certainly a call to the visitors’ room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force, had maintained a rigid silence.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"50153m “Everything,” he said, “proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person,—this sudden fortune, the facility with which I have overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"He had borne with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from being naked, dirty, and hungry.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,Andrea felt his heart leap with joy.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M.

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“Ah,” said Andrea, deeply affected.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“Oh, yes.” “That is well.” And Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,“Read?” he said.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,“What is that?” asked Andrea.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"“An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk to me.” “Oh,” cried Andrea, leaping with joy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"They wish for secrecy, since we are to converse in a private room.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"I understand, Bertuccio has been sent by my protector.” The keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"The room was whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"Bertuccio sat down upon the chair, Andrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den,"But it was not you, I presume, who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five months; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating at this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in Paris—amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I did very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to me just now;—it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two millions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 108. The Judge,"Perhaps it was the Christian exhortations of the abbé, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his persuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for Valentine.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,M. de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The whole establishment had been changed; another valet was engaged for himself, a new servant for Noirtier, two women had entered Madame de Villefort’s service,—in fact, everywhere, to the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different masters of the house, thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The assizes, also, were about to begin, and Villefort, shut up in his room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"This affair, like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in Paris.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death- bed, and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"But the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine, and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent, that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties, which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Once only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter was to learn his father’s name.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The magistrate, harassed and fatigued, had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar to that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose- trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"More than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning by the same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with the same gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house, whence he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from school to spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"While doing so, he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely distinguish.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and savage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly divested of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand, the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son, or to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from the drawing-room into the garden.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,Villefort became pale; he understood the old man’s meaning.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Noirtier continued to look at the same object, but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband, and Villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes, which, while changing their direction and even their language, had lost none of their menacing expression.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Madame de Villefort, unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment held her son’s ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Edward begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it; however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead streaming with perspiration.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead, pressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Villefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird to the serpent, walked towards the house.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"As he approached it, Noirtier’s gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a terrible menace.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have patience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.” Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand across his forehead, entered his study.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but Villefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the morning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses, and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The morning dawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its flickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"He opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief on the horizon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his memory.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt.” Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room, where he had seen him the preceding night.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The curtain was drawn, and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.” His head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his study; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to sleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,By degrees everyone awoke.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors, the ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid, mingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the enjoyment of his age.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him the papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,“What are you bringing me?” said he.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,“A cup of chocolate.” “I did not ask for it.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Who has paid me this attention?” “My mistress, sir.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your strength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,The valet then left the room.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion, he swallowed its contents at one draught.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"He then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 108. The Judge,"The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort felt no effects.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Come, my friend,” he said, thrusting his hand through the opening, “where are we going?” “Dentro la testa!” answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied by a menacing gesture.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Danglars thought dentro la testa meant, “Put in your head!” He was making rapid progress in Italian.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He obeyed, not without some uneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially one in such a situation as Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"His eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Before we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see double; and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,Danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,“Some gendarme!” he exclaimed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,“Can I have been intercepted by French telegrams to the pontifical authorities?” He resolved to end his anxiety.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,“Where are you taking me?” he asked.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Dentro la testa,” replied the same voice, with the same menacing accent.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,Danglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping on that side.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Decidedly,” said Danglars, with the perspiration on his forehead, “I must be under arrest.” And he threw himself back in the calash, not this time to sleep, but to think.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,Directly afterwards the moon rose.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He then saw the great aqueducts, those stone phantoms which he had before remarked, only then they were on the right hand, now they were on the left.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He understood that they had described a circle, and were bringing him back to Rome.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Oh, unfortunate!” he cried, “they must have obtained my arrest.” The carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"An hour of terror elapsed, for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"At length he saw a dark mass, against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash; but the vehicle turned to one side, leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling Rome.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"50243m “Mon dieu!” cried Danglars, “we are not returning to Rome; then it is not justice which is pursuing me!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,Gracious heavens; another idea presents itself—what if they should be——” His hair stood on end.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He remembered those interesting stories, so little believed in Paris, respecting Roman bandits; he remembered the adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry Mademoiselle Eugénie.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“They are robbers, perhaps,” he muttered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived monuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details Morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt sure that he must be on the Appian Way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"On the left, in a sort of valley, he perceived a circular excavation.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,It was Caracalla’s circus.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it stopped.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Di quà,” said one of the men, descending a little path leading out of the Appian Way.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another, like sentinels.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"After walking for about ten minutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds; three men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the centre.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,“Avanti!” said the same sharp and imperative voice.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"This time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker’s meaning, it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"This guide was our friend Peppino, who dashed into the thicket of high weeds, through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges; the rock, half open, afforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 114. Peppino,"Notwithstanding his large stomach, certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna, he slid down like Peppino, and closing his eyes fell upon his feet.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 114. Peppino,"50245m The path was wide, but dark.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Peppino, who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories, struck a light and lit a torch.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Two other men descended after Danglars forming the rearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop, they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the other, and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes, like those which we see on the faces of the dead.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,A sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,“Who comes there?” he cried.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“A friend, a friend!” said Peppino; “but where is the captain?” “There,” said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Fine spoil, captain, fine spoil!” said Peppino in Italian, and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door, through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Is this the man?” asked the captain, who was attentively reading Plutarch’s Life of Alexander.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Himself, captain—himself.” “Very well, show him to me.” At this rather impertinent order, Peppino raised his torch to the face of Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“The man is tired,” said the captain, “conduct him to his bed.” “Oh,” murmured Danglars, “that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall, and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards I see glistening in the darkness.” From their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by Albert de Morcerf reading Cæsar’s Commentaries, and by Danglars studying the Life of Alexander.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He no longer possessed strength, will, power, or feeling; he followed where they led him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase, and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Then a low door was opened before him, and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"The cell was clean, though empty, and dry, though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 114. Peppino,"Danglars brightened up on beholding it, fancying that it gave some promise of safety.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Oh, God be praised,” he said; “it is a real bed!” This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of God.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,He had not done so for ten years before.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"“Ecco!” said the guide, and pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed the door upon him.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"If there had been no bolt, it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of St. Sebastian, encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous Luigi Vampa.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose existence he would not believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in Paris; and not only did he recognize him, but the cell in which Albert had been confined, and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars, and restored him to some degree of tranquillity.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Since the bandits had not despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill him at all.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he had only a few louis about him, he doubted not he would be ransomed.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his own price at 8,000 crowns.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000 livres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,With this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 114. Peppino,"Therefore, tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position, provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he stretched himself on his bed, and after turning over two or three times, fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi Vampa was studying.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,He awoke.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,But in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“Yes, yes,” he murmured, “I am in the hands of the brigands of whom Albert de Morcerf spoke.” His first idea was to breathe, that he might know whether he was wounded.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"He borrowed this from Don Quixote, the only book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“No,” he cried, “they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed me!” and he thrust his hands into his pockets.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"They were untouched; the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were in his trousers pocket, and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note-case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,“Singular bandits!” he exclaimed; “they have left me my purse and pocket-book.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Hello, here is my watch!",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Let me see what time it is.” Danglars’ watch, one of Breguet’s repeaters, which he had carefully wound up on the previous night, struck half past five.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Without this, Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did not reach his cell.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Should he demand an explanation from the bandits, or should he wait patiently for them to propose it?",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"The last alternative seemed the most prudent, so he waited until twelve o’clock.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"During all this time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight o’clock, had been watching his door.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,50249m Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“Faugh!” he exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars, wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"He was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and a flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“Ah, ha,” cried Danglars, “this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be very good eating!” We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring voraciously.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“May I be hanged,” said Danglars, glancing at the bandit’s dinner through the crevices of the door,—“may I be hanged if I can understand how people can eat such filth!” and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes, which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said, “Monsieur Deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.” He got up and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Danglars knew that he was heard, so he redoubled his blows.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,“Che cosa?” asked the bandit.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“Come, come,” said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, “I think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!” But whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without answering, went on with his dinner.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Danglars’ feelings were hurt, and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Danglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach, arose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of the door, and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"It was, indeed, Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between his legs an earthen pan, containing chick-peas stewed with bacon.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,Near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a flask of Orvieto.,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"“On y va,” (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idioms.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner, “Put in your head!” But this was not the time for recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile: “Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?” “Does your excellency happen to be hungry?” “Happen to be hungry,—that’s pretty good, when I haven’t eaten for twenty-four hours!” muttered Danglars.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"Then he added aloud, “Yes, sir, I am hungry—very hungry.” “And your excellency wants something to eat?” “At once, if possible” “Nothing easier,” said Peppino.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,Let me have some dinner!” “At once!,THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare,"You mentioned a fowl, I think?” “Yes, a fowl.” Peppino, turning around, shouted, “A fowl for his excellency!” His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome, graceful, and half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head, without the assistance of his hands.",THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
