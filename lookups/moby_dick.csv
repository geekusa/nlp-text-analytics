Herman Melville,CHAPTER 16. The Ship.,"There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"(SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Philologically considered, it is absurd.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as ""whale oil,"" an inferior article in commerce.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios?",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,The Fin-Back is not gregarious.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES, that is, whales with baleen.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen's names for a few sorts.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"In connection with this appellative of ""Whalebone whales,"" it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,How then?,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 32. Cetology.,"And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this--the first lives aft, the last forward.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 33. The Specksynder.,"This it is, that for ever keeps God's true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.,"When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, ""Dinner, Mr. Stubb,"" and descends the scuttle.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.,"But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.,"It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"There are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or almost similar impressions effaced.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"So that here, in the real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,Already several fatalities had attended his chase.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"But though similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,That captain was Ahab.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.,"That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 41.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of The Whale.,"Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title ""Lord of the White Elephants"" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 44. The Chart.,"So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 44.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 44.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.,"In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.,"Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.,"But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.,"If, then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"Starbuck's body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 46. Surmises.,"For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.,"As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.,"There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

The Mat-Maker.,"Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and necessity--nowise incompatible--all interweavingly working together.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 47.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 47.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and gloss.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"There is some advantage in this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 60. The Line.,"Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 67.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 67.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 68.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.,"True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.,"That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.,But no more of this.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.,"Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

The Fountain.,"That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is surely a noteworthy thing.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,How is this?,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle.,MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85.

Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.,"And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head?",MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE
Herman Melville,CHAPTER 85.
